{"created":"2024-05-09 16:49:09","title":"On the construction of a family of well-posed approximate formulations for the stationary Stokes problem using an extended system","abstract":"We introduce an exact parameterized extended system such that, under adequate data, between the components of its solution, there is the solution of the weak formulation of the homogeneous Dirichlet problem for the stationary Stokes equations. In the extended system, we introduce the momentum equation together with two other forms of this one. This allows us to reformulate, for the stationary case, the consistent pressure Poisson equation of Sani, Shen, Pironneau, Gresho [\\textit{Int. J. Numer. Meth. Fluids}, \\textbf{50} (2006), pp. 673-682], from the unsteady case. In this way, we can retain the information we need for the approximate pressure on the boundary. We obtain a parameterized perturbed pressure Poisson equation for the stationary Stokes problem. We prove that to solve the stationary Stokes problem is equivalent to solve a problem for the momentum equation, the parameterized equation and the equation that defines the Laplace operator acting on velocity. The approximation of this last problem give a family of well - posed approximate formulations. The solution of each element of this family approximates the solution of the stationary Stokes problem. Some necessary variants of existing results on general Banach spaces are also developed. These concern the density of subspaces related to isomorphisms and the connection between the exact and the approximate problems. First, the well - posedness of the exact extended system is proved in some dense subspaces. The well posed approximate problem does not necessitate the discrete inf-sup condition. The paper is also related to the existing discussions on the boundary conditions for the pressure and on the imposing of the incompressibility constraint on the boundary.","sentences":["We introduce an exact parameterized extended system such that, under adequate data, between the components of its solution, there is the solution of the weak formulation of the homogeneous Dirichlet problem for the stationary Stokes equations.","In the extended system, we introduce the momentum equation together with two other forms of this one.","This allows us to reformulate, for the stationary case, the consistent pressure Poisson equation of Sani, Shen, Pironneau, Gresho [\\textit{Int.","J.

It represents a difficult combinatorial optimization problem. A typical large scale SoC with 120 partitions generates a search-space of nearly 10E250. As novel machine learning (ML) approaches emerge to tackle such problems, there is a growing need for a modern benchmark that comprises a large training dataset and performance metrics that better reflect real-world constraints and objectives compared to existing benchmarks. To address this need, we present FloorSet -- two comprehensive datasets of synthetic fixed-outline floorplan layouts that reflect the distribution of real SoCs. Each dataset has 1M training samples and 100 test samples where each sample is a synthetic floor-plan. FloorSet-Prime comprises fully-abutted rectilinear partitions and near-optimal wire-length. A simplified dataset that reflects early design phases, FloorSet-Lite comprises rectangular partitions, with under 5 percent white-space and near-optimal wire-length. Both datasets define hard constraints seen in modern design flows such as shape constraints, edge-affinity, grouping constraints, and pre-placement constraints. FloorSet is intended to spur fundamental research on large-scale constrained optimization problems. Crucially, FloorSet alleviates the core issue of reproducibility in modern ML driven solutions to such problems. FloorSet is available as an open-source repository for the research community.","sentences":["Floorplanning for systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) and its sub-systems is a crucial and non-trivial step of the physical design flow.","It represents a difficult combinatorial optimization problem.","A typical large scale SoC with 120 partitions generates a search-space of nearly 10E250.","As novel machine learning (ML) approaches emerge to tackle such problems, there is a growing need for a modern benchmark that comprises a large training dataset and performance metrics that better reflect real-world constraints and objectives compared to existing benchmarks.","To address this need, we present FloorSet -- two comprehensive datasets of synthetic fixed-outline floorplan layouts that reflect the distribution of real SoCs.","Each dataset has 1M training samples and 100 test samples where each sample is a synthetic floor-plan.","FloorSet-Prime comprises fully-abutted rectilinear partitions and near-optimal wire-length.","A simplified dataset that reflects early design phases, FloorSet-Lite comprises rectangular partitions, with under 5 percent white-space and near-optimal wire-length.","Both datasets define hard constraints seen in modern design flows such as shape constraints, edge-affinity, grouping constraints, and pre-placement constraints.","FloorSet is intended to spur fundamental research on large-scale constrained optimization problems.","Crucially, FloorSet alleviates the core issue of reproducibility in modern ML driven solutions to such problems.","FloorSet is available as an open-source repository for the research community."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05480v1","category":"cs.AR"}
{"created":"2024-05-09 13:48:11","title":"JADES -- The small blue bump in GN-z11: insights into the nuclear region of a galaxy at z=10.6","abstract":"We report the detection of continuum excess in the rest-frame UV between 3000 {\\AA} and 3550 {\\AA} in the JWST/NIRSpec spectrum of GN-z11, a galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z = 10.603. The shape of the continuum excess resembles a Balmer continuum but has a break around 3546 {\\AA} in the rest frame, which is 100 {\\AA} bluewards to the Balmer limit at 3646 {\\AA}. A Balmer continuum model alone cannot fit the spectrum, implying a different origin for the continuum excess. The absence of the Balmer jump indicates an electron temperature of $\\sim 3\\times 10^4$ K, which is significantly higher than the temperature of $T_{e}({\\rm O^{2+}}) \\approx 1.3\\times 10^{4}$ K inferred from [OIII]$\\lambda 4363$. The temperature difference must result from mixing of different ionized regions: the Balmer emission mainly arises from dense and hot clouds in the Broad Line Region, close to the accreting black hole, whereas the forbidden lines originate from less dense and colder gas in the host galaxy (although these ionized regions are kinematically similar in GN-z11 due to its small BH mass). We propose a potential explanation for the observed continuum excess to come from a complex of FeII emission, which shows a characteristic jump bluewards to the Balmer limit as previously seen in the spectra of many lower-redshift quasars. Through comparisons with Cloudy models, we show an Fe abundance or an overall metallicity above $\\sim 1/3$ solar is likely needed. Besides the FeII emission, part of the small blue bump might also be associated with an OIII Bowen fluorescent line, a line often enhanced in dense AGN-ionized gas. Finally, the spectrum provides further evidence against Wolf-Rayet or massive stars dominating the nebular emission in GN-z11.","sentences":["We report the detection of continuum excess in the rest-frame UV between 3000 {\\AA} and 3550 {\\AA} in the JWST/NIRSpec spectrum of GN-z11, a galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z = 10.603.","The shape of the continuum excess resembles a Balmer continuum but has a break around 3546 {\\AA} in the rest frame, which is 100 {\\AA} bluewards to the Balmer limit at 3646 {\\AA}.","A Balmer continuum model alone cannot fit the spectrum, implying a different origin for the continuum excess.","The absence of the Balmer jump indicates an electron temperature of $\\sim 3\\times 10^4$ K, which is significantly higher than the temperature of $T_{e}({\\rm O^{2+}})","\\approx 1.3\\times 10^{4}$ K inferred from [OIII]$\\lambda 4363$.","The temperature difference must result from mixing of different ionized regions: the Balmer emission mainly arises from dense and hot clouds in the Broad Line Region, close to the accreting black hole, whereas the forbidden lines originate from less dense and colder gas in the host galaxy (although these ionized regions are kinematically similar in GN-z11 due to its small BH mass).","We propose a potential explanation for the observed continuum excess to come from a complex of FeII emission, which shows a characteristic jump bluewards to the Balmer limit as previously seen in the spectra of many lower-redshift quasars.","Through comparisons with Cloudy models, we show an Fe abundance or an overall metallicity above $\\sim 1/3$ solar is likely needed.","Besides the FeII emission, part of the small blue bump might also be associated with an OIII Bowen fluorescent line, a line often enhanced in dense AGN-ionized gas.","Finally, the spectrum provides further evidence against Wolf-Rayet or massive stars dominating the nebular emission in GN-z11."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05772v1","category":"astro-ph.GA"}
