In this study, we employ the unrestricted vectorization variant of AVQD to simulate and benchmark various non-unitarily evolving systems. We exemplify how construction of an expressible ansatz unitary and the associated operator pool can be implemented to analyze examples such as the Fenna Matthews Olson complex (FMO) and even the permutational invariant Dicke model of quantum optics. We furthermore show an efficient decomposition scheme for the ansatz used, which can extend its applications to a wide range of other open quantum system scenarios in near future. In all cases the results obtained are in excellent agreement with exact numerical computations which bolsters the effectiveness of this technique.

The term dialect identifies one of the possible sub-languages that can be encoded inside of an eQR code via QRscript. This specification will describe an intermediate representation of QRtree, made through a language derived by the three-address code. It will then define the transformation rules from the intermediate representation to a binary code. The latter is a binary representation called eQRtreebytecode. These rules can also be applied inversely to transform the eQRtreeBytecode into the intermediate representation. This specification document will pay particular attention to the creation of a compact eQRtreebytecode, as the maximum number of bits that can be stored in a QR code is, at the time of writing, equal to 2953 bytes (in the case of QR code version 40 with a \"low\" error correction level).","sentences":["This specification document specifies the syntax and semantics of QRtree, which is a specific dialect of QRscript particularly suited to represent decision trees without chance nodes.","The term dialect identifies one of the possible sub-languages that can be encoded inside of an eQR code via QRscript.","This specification will describe an intermediate representation of QRtree, made through a language derived by the three-address code.","It will then define the transformation rules from the intermediate representation to a binary code.","The latter is a binary representation called eQRtreebytecode.","These rules can also be applied inversely to transform the eQRtreeBytecode into the intermediate representation.","This specification document will pay particular attention to the creation of a compact eQRtreebytecode, as the maximum number of bits that can be stored in a QR code is, at the time of writing, equal to 2953 bytes (in the case of QR code version 40 with a \"low\" error correction level)."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04716v1","category":"cs.NI"}
