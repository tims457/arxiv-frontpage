Major mergers and gas accretion are often invoked to explain DSFGs' prodigious star-formation rates (SFRs) and large stellar masses. We conducted a spatially-resolved morphological analysis of the rest-frame UV/NIR emission in three DSFGs at z~2.5. Initially discovered as CO emitters by NOEMA observations of a bright Herschel source, we observed them with the JWST/NIRCam as part of the PEARLS program. The NIRCam data reveal the galaxies' stellar population and dust distribution on scales of 250 pc. Spatial variations in stellar mass, SFR, and dust extinction are determined in resolved maps obtained through pixel-based SED fitting. The CO emitters are massive, dusty starburst galaxies with SFRs ranging from 340 to 2500 Msun/yr, positioning them among the most active SFGs at 2<z<3. Notably, they belong to the ~1.5% of the entire JWST population with extremely red colors. Their morphologies are disk-like, with effective radii of 2.0-4.4 kpc, and exhibit sub-structures such as clumps and spiral arms. The galaxies have dust extinctions up to Av=5-7 mag with asymmetric distributions extending over several kpc and including off-center regions resembling bent spiral arms and clumps. The NIR dust-attenuation curve in these sources deviates from standard laws, implying different dust grain properties than commonly assumed in starburst galaxies. The proximity of galaxies with consistent redshifts, strong color gradients, overall disturbed appearance, asymmetric dust obscuration, and wide-spread star formation favor interactions (minor mergers and flybys) as the mechanism driving the CO galaxies' exceptional SFRs. Their large masses and rich environment hint at membership in two proto-structures, as initially inferred from their association with a Planck-selected high-z source.","sentences":["Dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) contribute significantly to the stellar buildup at cosmic noon.","Major mergers and gas accretion are often invoked to explain DSFGs' prodigious star-formation rates (SFRs) and large stellar masses.","We conducted a spatially-resolved morphological analysis of the rest-frame UV/NIR emission in three DSFGs at z~2.5.","Initially discovered as CO emitters by NOEMA observations of a bright Herschel source, we observed them with the JWST/NIRCam as part of the PEARLS program.","The NIRCam data reveal the galaxies' stellar population and dust distribution on scales of 250 pc.","Spatial variations in stellar mass, SFR, and dust extinction are determined in resolved maps obtained through pixel-based SED fitting.","The CO emitters are massive, dusty starburst galaxies with SFRs ranging from 340 to 2500 Msun/yr, positioning them among the most active SFGs at 2<z<3.","Notably, they belong to the ~1.5% of the entire JWST population with extremely red colors.","Their morphologies are disk-like, with effective radii of 2.0-4.4 kpc, and exhibit sub-structures such as clumps and spiral arms.","The galaxies have dust extinctions up to Av=5-7 mag with asymmetric distributions extending over several kpc and including off-center regions resembling bent spiral arms and clumps.","The NIR dust-attenuation curve in these sources deviates from standard laws, implying different dust grain properties than commonly assumed in starburst galaxies.","The proximity of galaxies with consistent redshifts, strong color gradients, overall disturbed appearance, asymmetric dust obscuration, and wide-spread star formation favor interactions (minor mergers and flybys) as the mechanism driving the CO galaxies' exceptional SFRs.","Their large masses and rich environment hint at membership in two proto-structures, as initially inferred from their association with a Planck-selected high-z source."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07986v1","category":"astro-ph.GA"}

In this work, we target the mass-losing carbon star V Hydrae (V Hya), looking for signatures of its companion in the dust forming region of the atmosphere. The star was observed in the L- and N-bands with the VLTI/MATISSE instrument at low spectral resolution. We reconstructed images of V Hya's photosphere and surroundings using the two bands and compared our interferometric observables with VLTI/MIDI and VISIR archival data. To constrain the dust properties, we used DUSTY to model the spectral energy distribution. The star is dominated by dust emission in the L- and N- bands. The VISIR image confirms the presence of a large-scale dusty circumstellar envelope surrounding V Hya. The MATISSE reconstructed images show asymmetric and elongated structures in both infrared bands. In the L-band, we detected an elongated shape of approximately 15 mas, likely to be of photospheric origin. In the N-band, we found a 20 mas extension North-East from the star, and perpendicular to the L-band elongated axis. The position angle and the size of the N-band extension match the prediction of the companion position at MATISSE epoch. By comparing MATISSE N-band with MIDI data, we deduce that the elongation axis in the N-band has rotated since the previous interferometric measurements 13 years ago, supporting the idea that the particle enhancement is related to the dusty clump moving along with the companion. The MATISSE images unveil the presence of a dust enhancement at the companion position, opening new doors for further analysis on the binary interaction with an AGB component.","sentences":["Our purpose is to study the effect of binary companions located within the first 10 stellar radii from the primary AGB star.","In this work, we target the mass-losing carbon star V Hydrae (V Hya), looking for signatures of its companion in the dust forming region of the atmosphere.","The star was observed in the L- and N-bands with the VLTI/MATISSE instrument at low spectral resolution.","We reconstructed images of V Hya's photosphere and surroundings using the two bands and compared our interferometric observables with VLTI/MIDI and VISIR archival data.","To constrain the dust properties, we used DUSTY to model the spectral energy distribution.","The star is dominated by dust emission in the L- and N- bands.","The VISIR image confirms the presence of a large-scale dusty circumstellar envelope surrounding V Hya.","The MATISSE reconstructed images show asymmetric and elongated structures in both infrared bands.","In the L-band, we detected an elongated shape of approximately 15 mas, likely to be of photospheric origin.","In the N-band, we found a 20 mas extension North-East from the star, and perpendicular to the L-band elongated axis.","The position angle and the size of the N-band extension match the prediction of the companion position at MATISSE epoch.","By comparing MATISSE N-band with MIDI data, we deduce that the elongation axis in the N-band has rotated since the previous interferometric measurements 13 years ago, supporting the idea that the particle enhancement is related to the dusty clump moving along with the companion.","The MATISSE images unveil the presence of a dust enhancement at the companion position, opening new doors for further analysis on the binary interaction with an AGB component."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07821v1","category":"astro-ph.SR"}

However, current model predictions do to not fully reproduce the solar abundances. We investigate the impact of different explosion energies and parameters on the nucleosynthesis of p-nuclei, by studying stellar models with different initial masses and CCSN explosions. We find that the total p-nuclei yields are only marginally affected by the CCSN explosion prescriptions if the $\\gamma$-process production is already efficient in the stellar progenitors due to a C-O shell merger. In most of CCSN explosions from progenitors without C-O shell merger, the $\\gamma$-process yields increase with the explosion energy up to an order of magnitude, depending on the progenitor structure and the CCSN prescriptions. The trend of the p-nuclei production with the explosion energy is more complicated if we look at the production of single p-nuclei.

In particular, for the CCSN models where the $\\alpha$-rich freeze-out component is ejected, the yields of the lightest p-nuclei increase by up to three orders of magnitude.

The main caveats of this platform, however, are that the predicted Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the SM is too small to achieve substantial topological minigaps and that the MZMs typically coexist with a finite background of trivial subgap states. In order to overcome both problems, we explore the advantages of utilizing core-shell hole-band NWs for the SM part of the full-shell hybrid, with an insulating core and an active SM shell. In particular, we consider InP/GaSb core-shell NWs, which allow to exploit the unique characteristics of the III-V compound SM valence bands. We demonstrate that they exhibit a robust hole SOC that depends mainly on SM and geometrical parameters. In other words, the SOC is intrinsic and does not rely on neither electric fields, which are non-tunable in a full-shell hybrid geometry, nor on the strain at the interface, contrary to what happens in Ge/Si heterostructures where the strain plays a crucial role.

Specifically, (1) we investigate the case where the number of regressors can grow faster than the sample size, (2) we pay particular attention to non-Gaussian, serially and cross-sectionally correlated and heteroskedastic error processes, and (3) we develop an estimation method for high-dimensional long-run covariance matrix using a thresholded estimator.   Methodologically and technically, we develop two Nagaev-types of concentration inequalities: one for a partial sum and the other for a quadratic form, subject to a set of easily verifiable conditions. Leveraging these two inequalities, we also derive a non-asymptotic bound for the LASSO estimator, achieve asymptotic normality via the node-wise LASSO regression, and establish a sharp convergence rate for the thresholded heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimator.

We investigate whether notable circumferential ridges seen on Saturn's moons may be a byproduct of free flow of loosely packed regolith. Such ridges and other features likely record the history of the moons, and we find that if surface grains are freely flowing, then the combined gravity of Saturn itself and its tenuous ring generate similar circumferential features. Moreover, analysis of these features reveals the possibility of previously unreported morphologies, for example a stationary torus around a non rotating satellite. Some of these features persist even for a very low density and distant disk. This raises the prospect that nonlinear analysis of interactions from disks to moons and back again may lead to new insights.","sentences":["Exploratory missions have found that regolith on interplanetary bodies can be loosely packed and freely flowing, a state that strongly affects mission plans and that may also influence the large scale shapes of these bodies.","We investigate whether notable circumferential ridges seen on Saturn's moons may be a byproduct of free flow of loosely packed regolith.","Such ridges and other features likely record the history of the moons, and we find that if surface grains are freely flowing, then the combined gravity of Saturn itself and its tenuous ring generate similar circumferential features.","Moreover, analysis of these features reveals the possibility of previously unreported morphologies, for example a stationary torus around a non rotating satellite.","Some of these features persist even for a very low density and distant disk.","This raises the prospect that nonlinear analysis of interactions from disks to moons and back again may lead to new insights."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07401v1","category":"astro-ph.EP"}

In this work, we consider a simple system of coupled Helmholtz resonators and study their properties associated with the tuning of coupling strength and symmetry breaking. We numerically and experimentally demonstrate the excitation of quasi-bound state in the continuum in the resonators placed in a free space and in a rectangular cavity.

The disorder being mobile, the total degrees of freedom and the potential energy landscape of the pure system are preserved in our model. The mechanical failure and the shear band formation in the amorphous solid in the presence of annealed disorder are studied at the microscopic level by employing the finite shear deformation protocol at nonzero temperature. A significant enhancement in the shear modulus and yield stress is observed as a function of the heaviness of the impurity particles. Via the analysis of the non-affine displacement field and the microscopic strain fluctuations and the nature of their spatial correlations we find that the shear band formation in the plastic regime is gradually suppressed with increasing impurity mass. Eventually, a critical mass of the disordered particles is identified above which the plastic events become completely localized. This is marked by a transition from a power law to an exponential decay in the spatial correlations non-affine displacement field. Likewise, a similar change is observed in the strain correlation function, transitioning from a slower $1/r$ decay to a more rapid $1/r^3$ decay.

If their masses are in the MeV to several GeV range, HNLs are light enough to be copiously produced at collider and accelerator facilities, but also heavy enough to decay to visible particles on length scales that can be observed in particle detectors. Previous studies evaluating the sensitivities of experiments have often focused on simple, but not particularly well-motivated, models in which the HNL mixes with only one active neutrino flavor. In this work, we accurately simulate models for HNL masses between 100 MeV and 10 GeV and arbitrary couplings to $e$, $\\mu$, and $\\tau$ leptons. We include over 150 HNL production channels and over 100 HNL decay modes, including all of the processes that can be dominant in some region of the general parameter space. The result is HNLCalc, a user-friendly, fast, and flexible library to compute the properties of HNL models. As examples, we implement HNLCalc to extend the FORESEE package to evaluate the prospects for HNL discovery at forward LHC experiments. We present sensitivity reaches for FASER and FASER2 in five benchmark scenarios with coupling ratios $|U_e|^2 : |U_\\mu|^2 : |U_{\\tau}|^2$ = 1:0:0, 0:1:0, 0:0:1, 0:1:1, and 1:1:1, where the latter two have not been studied previously.
