The sluggish kinetics of the CO2RR require the development of novel strategies for electrocatalyst design.

This study follows the first principles based DFT-D method to examine the electrocatalytic competences of the defective two-dimensional boron nitride monolayer (d-BN) material towards CO2RR. Introducing a particular defect with nitrogen vacancies in the 2D single layer pristine hexagonal boron nitride (VN_d-BN) can efficiently activate the CO2 molecules for hydrogenation by reducing the electronic band gap of the pristine hBN from 6.23 eV to 3.0 eV. Therefore, VN_d-BN material can act as a large band gap semiconductor. Our findings demonstrate that the defective regions in the 2D monolayer VN_d-BN serve as active sites (Boron) for both the adsorption and activation of CO2. The subsequent hydrogenation steps occur sequentially once the CO2 molecule is adsorbed on the catalytic surface. Our results indicate that the OCHO* path is the most favorable for CH4 production.

In this work, the thermal conductivity of NPM with crystalline Si (c-Si) pillar, crystalline Ge (c-Ge) pillar and amorphous Si (a-Si) pillar are systematically investigated by molecular dynamics method. The analyses of phonon dispersion and spectral energy density show that phonon dispersions of Si membrane are flattened due to local resonant hybridization induced by both crystalline and amorphous pillar. In addition, a-Si pillar can cause larger reduction of thermal conductivity compared with c-Si pillar. Specifically, when increasing the atomic mass of atoms in pillars, the thermal conductivity of NPMs with crystalline pillar is increased because of the weakened phonon hybridization, however, the thermal conductivity of NPMs with amorphous pillar is almost unchanged, which indicates that the phonon transports are mainly affected by the scatterings at the interface between amorphous pillar and Si membrane. The results of this work can provide meaningful insights on controlling thermal transport in NPMs by choosing the materials and atomic mass of pillars for specific applications.","sentences":["Tuning thermal transport in nanostructures is essential for many applications, such as thermal management and thermoelectrics.","Nanophononic metamaterials (NPM) have shown great potential for reducing thermal conductivity by introducing local resonant hybridization.","In this work, the thermal conductivity of NPM with crystalline Si (c-Si) pillar, crystalline Ge (c-Ge) pillar and amorphous Si (a-Si) pillar are systematically investigated by molecular dynamics method.","The analyses of phonon dispersion and spectral energy density show that phonon dispersions of Si membrane are flattened due to local resonant hybridization induced by both crystalline and amorphous pillar.","In addition, a-Si pillar can cause larger reduction of thermal conductivity compared with c-Si pillar.","Specifically, when increasing the atomic mass of atoms in pillars, the thermal conductivity of NPMs with crystalline pillar is increased because of the weakened phonon hybridization, however, the thermal conductivity of NPMs with amorphous pillar is almost unchanged, which indicates that the phonon transports are mainly affected by the scatterings at the interface between amorphous pillar and Si membrane.","The results of this work can provide meaningful insights on controlling thermal transport in NPMs by choosing the materials and atomic mass of pillars for specific applications."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09148v1","category":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci"}

Fermi-LAT reported a daily average flux of 5x10^-6 phs cm^-2 s^-1, which is about 60 times its average value. We investigated this extraordinary outbreak through temporal and multi-wavelength analysis. From the statistical analysis of the gamma-ray lightcurves using Bayesian blocks, we identified 3 epochs of prominent flares. The fastest flux decay during this major outburst was observed within 5.5 +/- 0.7 hours. The highest energy of gamma-ray photons found from the source during the active phase is ~ 82 GeV. Using the transparency of gamma-rays against pair production and light crossing time argument, we could obtain the minimum jet Doppler factor as 17 corresponding to the flaring state.The broadband spectral energy distribution study performed using synchrotron, SSC and EC emission processes supports the external Compton scattering of IR photons as the likely mechanism for the gamma-ray emission from the source. The results of this study suggest the scenario of the emission region in 4C 31.03, being located beyond the Broad-line region from the central blackhole. Long-term gamma-ray flux distribution of 4C 31.03 depicts a double log-normal variability, indicating that two distinct flux states are active in this energy band. The index distribution also reveals a two distinct variability patterns, suggesting that the gamma-ray spectrum can be more precisely described by two photon indices.","sentences":["The blazar 4C 31.03 recently underwent a major gamma-ray outburst at the beginning of 2023 after a prolonged quiescent phase.","Fermi-LAT reported a daily average flux of 5x10^-6 phs cm^-2 s^-1, which is about 60 times its average value.","We investigated this extraordinary outbreak through temporal and multi-wavelength analysis.","From the statistical analysis of the gamma-ray lightcurves using Bayesian blocks, we identified 3 epochs of prominent flares.","The fastest flux decay during this major outburst was observed within 5.5 +/- 0.7 hours.","The highest energy of gamma-ray photons found from the source during the active phase is ~ 82 GeV.

Advanced heterogeneous integration not only constitutes a pivotal technique for fabricating these electronics but also offers potential solutions for thermal management. This study presents the integration of high thermal conductivity semiconductors, specifically, 3C-SiC thin films and diamond substrates, through a room-temperature surface-activated bonding technique. Notably, the thermal conductivity of the 3C-SiC films is among the highest for all semiconductor films which can be integrated near room temperature with similar thicknesses. Furthermore, following annealing, the interfaces between 3C-SiC and diamond demonstrate a remarkable enhancement in thermal boundary conductance (TBC), reaching up to approximately 300%, surpassing all other grown and bonded heterointerfaces. This enhancement is attributed to interfacial reactions, specifically the transformation of amorphous silicon into SiC upon interaction with diamond, which is further corroborated by picosecond ultrasonics measurements. Subsequent to annealing at 1100 C, the achieved TBC (150 MW/m2-K) is record-high among all bonded diamond interfaces. Additionally, the visualization of large-area TBC, facilitated by femtosecond laser-based time-domain thermoreflectance measurements, shows the uniformity of the interfaces which are capable of withstanding temperatures as high as 1100 C. Our research marks a significant advancement in the realm of thermally conductive heterogeneous integration, which is promising for enhanced cooling of next-generation electronics.","sentences":["Overheating has emerged as a primary challenge constraining the reliability and performance of next-generation high-performance electronics, such as chiplets and (ultra)wide bandgap electronics.","Advanced heterogeneous integration not only constitutes a pivotal technique for fabricating these electronics but also offers potential solutions for thermal management.","This study presents the integration of high thermal conductivity semiconductors, specifically, 3C-SiC thin films and diamond substrates, through a room-temperature surface-activated bonding technique.","Notably, the thermal conductivity of the 3C-SiC films is among the highest for all semiconductor films which can be integrated near room temperature with similar thicknesses.","Furthermore, following annealing, the interfaces between 3C-SiC and diamond demonstrate a remarkable enhancement in thermal boundary conductance (TBC), reaching up to approximately 300%, surpassing all other grown and bonded heterointerfaces.","This enhancement is attributed to interfacial reactions, specifically the transformation of amorphous silicon into SiC upon interaction with diamond, which is further corroborated by picosecond ultrasonics measurements.","Subsequent to annealing at 1100 C, the achieved TBC (150 MW/m2-K) is record-high among all bonded diamond interfaces.","Additionally, the visualization of large-area TBC, facilitated by femtosecond laser-based time-domain thermoreflectance measurements, shows the uniformity of the interfaces which are capable of withstanding temperatures as high as 1100 C.
