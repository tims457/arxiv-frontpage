However, the amount of memory required to store the KV cache can become prohibitive at long sequence lengths and large batch sizes. Since the invention of the transformer, two of the most effective interventions discovered for reducing the size of the KV cache have been Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and its generalization, Grouped-Query Attention (GQA). MQA and GQA both modify the design of the attention block so that multiple query heads can share a single key/value head, reducing the number of distinct key/value heads by a large factor while only minimally degrading accuracy. In this paper, we show that it is possible to take Multi-Query Attention a step further by also sharing key and value heads between adjacent layers, yielding a new attention design we call Cross-Layer Attention (CLA). With CLA, we find that it is possible to reduce the size of the KV cache by another 2x while maintaining nearly the same accuracy as unmodified MQA.

From an input polygon soup, the algorithm first computes the co-refinement, with an exact representation of the intersection points. Then, the decomposition of 3D space into volumetric regions (Weiler model) is constructed, by sorting the facets around the non-manifold intersection edges (radial sort), using specialized exact predicates. Finally, based on the input boolean expression, the triangular facets that belong to the boundary of the result are classified. This is, to our knowledge, the first algorithm that computes an exact Weiler model. To implement all the involved predicates and constructions, two geometric kernels are proposed, tested and discussed (arithmetic expansions and multi-precision floating-point). As a guiding principle,the combinatorial information shared between each step is kept as simple as possible. It is made possible by treating all the particular cases in the kernel.

The latter may be quantified by a memory function within the framework of the linear generalised Langevin equation (GLE). Here, we exemplify the implications of steady driving on the memory function of a colloidal model system for Brownian motion in a corrugated potential landscape, specifically, for one-dimensional motion in a sinusoidal potential. To this end, we consider the overdamped limit of the GLE, which is facilitated by separating the memory function into a singular (Markovian) and a regular (non-Markovian) part. Relying on exact solutions for the investigated model, we show that the random force entering the GLE must display a bias far from equilibrium, which corroborates a recent general prediction. Based on data for the mean-square displacement obtained from Brownian dynamics simulations, we estimate the memory function for different driving strengths and show that already moderate driving accelerates the decay of the memory function by several orders of magnitude in time. We find that the memory may persist on much longer timescales than expected from the convergence of the mean-square displacement to its long-time asymptote. Furthermore, the functional form of the memory function changes from a monotonic decay to a non-monotonic, damped oscillatory behaviour, which can be understood from a competition of confined motion and depinning. Our analysis of the simulation data further reveals a pronounced non-Gaussianity, which questions the Gaussian approximation of the random force entering the GLE.","sentences":["The transport of individual particles in inhomogeneous environments is complex and exhibits non-Markovian responses.","The latter may be quantified by a memory function within the framework of the linear generalised Langevin equation (GLE).","Here, we exemplify the implications of steady driving on the memory function of a colloidal model system for Brownian motion in a corrugated potential landscape, specifically, for one-dimensional motion in a sinusoidal potential.","To this end, we consider the overdamped limit of the GLE, which is facilitated by separating the memory function into a singular (Markovian) and a regular (non-Markovian) part.","Relying on exact solutions for the investigated model, we show that the random force entering the GLE must display a bias far from equilibrium, which corroborates a recent general prediction.","Based on data for the mean-square displacement obtained from Brownian dynamics simulations, we estimate the memory function for different driving strengths and show that already moderate driving accelerates the decay of the memory function by several orders of magnitude in time.","We find that the memory may persist on much longer timescales than expected from the convergence of the mean-square displacement to its long-time asymptote.","Furthermore, the functional form of the memory function changes from a monotonic decay to a non-monotonic, damped oscillatory behaviour, which can be understood from a competition of confined motion and depinning.","Our analysis of the simulation data further reveals a pronounced non-Gaussianity, which questions the Gaussian approximation of the random force entering the GLE."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12904v1","category":"cond-mat.soft"}

This phenomenon is commonly referred to as nonreciprocity. In addition to the fact that it is of great interest to understand the fundamental physical mechanism leading to this nonreciprocal propagation, the phenomenon of magnon nonreciprocity may be used to design magnon-based logic devices. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a significantly large spin-orbit coupling can lead to giant nonreciprocity of exchange-dominated terahertz magnons, when they are excited by means of spin-polarized electrons [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126702 (2024)]. Here, by providing experimental results on two additional systems we demonstrate the generality of the observed phenomenon. Comparing the results of a Co/Ni bilayer on Ir(001) to those of a Co double layer on Ir(001) and W(110) we unravel the impact of the interfacial electronic hybridization on the observed phenomenon and provide further insights into the microscopic mechanism leading to this nonreciprocal magnon excitation. It was observed that the interfacial electronic hybridization, which is governing the magnetic properties of the interface atomic layer, is somewhat important but is not crucial for the magnon nonreciprocity. On the other hand the choice of the incident energy of the incoming electron beam is decisive for the observation of the effect.

This paper introduces a more flexible framework, the non-parametric Box-Cox model with unspecified transformation, to address model mis-specification in high-dimensional linear hypothesis testing while preserving the interpretation of regression coefficients. Model estimation and computation in high dimensions poses challenges beyond traditional sparse penalization methods. We propose the constrained partial penalized composite probit regression method for sparse estimation and investigate its statistical properties. Additionally, we present a computationally efficient algorithm using augmented Lagrangian and coordinate majorization descent for solving regularization problems with folded concave penalization and linear constraints.

The inversion symmetry breaking in rhombohedral-stacked transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) endows them with an interfacial ferroelectricity associated with an out-of-plane electric polarization.

Deformable image registration (DIR) consists in estimating the required spatial transformation to align a moving image with a fixed one. However, it is acknowledged that, boundary conditions applied to the solution are critical in preventing mis-registration. Despite the extensive research on registration techniques, relatively few have addressed the issue of boundary conditions in the context of medical DIR. Our aim is a step towards customizing boundary conditions to suit the diverse registration tasks at hand.   Approach: We propose a generic, locally adaptive, Robin-type condition enabling to balance between Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, depending on incoming/outgoing flow fields on the image boundaries. The proposed framework is entirely automatized through the determination of a reduced set of hyperparameters optimized via energy minimization.   Main results: The proposed approach was tested on a mono-modal CT thorax registration task and an abdominal CT to MRI registration task. For the first task, we observed a relative improvement in terms of target registration error of up to 12% (mean 4%), compared to homogeneous Dirichlet and homogeneous Neumann.

However, seamlessly introducing polyps into complex endoscopic environments while simultaneously generating accurate pseudo-masks remains a challenge for current inpainting methods. To address these issues, we first leverage the pre-trained Stable Diffusion Inpaint and ControlNet, to introduce a robust generative model capable of inpainting polyps across different backgrounds. Secondly, we utilize the prior that synthetic polyps are confined to the inpainted region, to establish an inpainted region-guided pseudo-mask refinement network. We also propose a sample selection strategy that prioritizes well-aligned and hard synthetic cases for further model fine-tuning.

This view has been repeatedly challenged in the literature, most commonly for the bright hot Am star o Peg. Several studies claimed to detect 1-2 kG field of unknown topology in this object, possibly indicating a new process of magnetic field generation in intermediate-mass stars. In this study, we revisit the evidence of a strong magnetic field in o Peg using new high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations and advanced spectral fitting techniques. The mean magnetic field strength in o Peg is estimated from the high-precision CRIRES+ measurement of near-infrared sulphur lines.

In addition, the least-squares deconvolution multi-line technique is employed to derive longitudinal field measurements from archival optical spectropolarimetric observations of this star. Our analysis of the near-infrared S I lines reveals no evidence of Zeeman broadening, ruling out magnetic field with a strength exceeding 260 G. This null result is compatible with the relative intensification of Fe II lines in the optical spectrum taking into account blending and uncertain atomic parameters of the relevant diagnostic transitions. Longitudinal field measurements at three different nights also yield null results with a precision of 2 G. This study refutes the claims of kG-strength dipolar or tangled magnetic field in o Peg.

We challenge the prevalent hypothesis that the $L_2$ norm of weights is the primary cause of grokking by demonstrating that grokking can occur outside the expected range of weight norms. To better understand grokking, we introduce three new progress measures: activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, and approximate local circuit complexity.

Strong sublinearity necessitates that the synaptic distribution in PCs be globally scattered sensitive, whereas weak sublinearity facilitates the generation of complex firing patterns in PCs. Leveraging dendritic branches characterized by strong sublinearity as computational units, we demonstrate that a neuron can adeptly address the feature-binding problem.

{"created":"2024-05-21 09:12:20","title":"Quantifying Emergence in Large Language Models","abstract":"Emergence, broadly conceptualized as the ``intelligent'' behaviors of LLMs, has recently been studied and proved challenging to quantify due to the lack of a measurable definition. Most commonly, it has been estimated statistically through model performances across extensive datasets and tasks, which consumes significant resources. In addition, such estimation is difficult to interpret and may not accurately reflect the models' intrinsic emergence. In this work, we propose a quantifiable solution for estimating emergence. Inspired by emergentism in dynamics, we quantify the strength of emergence by comparing the entropy reduction of the macroscopic (semantic) level with that of the microscopic (token) level, both of which are derived from the representations within the transformer block.

This motivates the use of statistical techniques to provide accurate and calibrated probabilistic predictions at a lower cost compared to numerical simulations. Wind represents a particularly challenging variable to model due to its high spatial and temporal variability. This paper presents a novel approach that integrates Gaussian processes (GPs) and neural networks to model surface wind gusts, leveraging multiple data sources, including numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, digital elevation models (DEM), and in-situ measurements. Results demonstrate the added value of modeling the multivariate covariance structure of the variable of interest, as opposed to only applying a univariate probabilistic regression approach. Modeling the covariance enables the optimal integration of observed measurements from ground stations, which is shown to reduce the continuous ranked probability score compared to the baseline. Moreover, it allows the direct generation of realistic fields that are also marginally calibrated, aided by scalable techniques such as Random Fourier Features (RFF) and pathwise conditioning. We discuss the effect of different modeling choices, as well as different degrees of approximation, and present our results for a case study.","sentences":["Accurately representing surface weather at the sub-kilometer scale is crucial for optimal decision-making in a wide range of applications.","This motivates the use of statistical techniques to provide accurate and calibrated probabilistic predictions at a lower cost compared to numerical simulations.","Wind represents a particularly challenging variable to model due to its high spatial and temporal variability.","This paper presents a novel approach that integrates Gaussian processes (GPs) and neural networks to model surface wind gusts, leveraging multiple data sources, including numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, digital elevation models (DEM), and in-situ measurements.","Results demonstrate the added value of modeling the multivariate covariance structure of the variable of interest, as opposed to only applying a univariate probabilistic regression approach.","Modeling the covariance enables the optimal integration of observed measurements from ground stations, which is shown to reduce the continuous ranked probability score compared to the baseline.","Moreover, it allows the direct generation of realistic fields that are also marginally calibrated, aided by scalable techniques such as Random Fourier Features (RFF) and pathwise conditioning.","We discuss the effect of different modeling choices, as well as different degrees of approximation, and present our results for a case study."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12614v1","category":"physics.ao-ph"}

Although these methods offer high explainability, it falls short in accuracy compared to traditional fine-tuning approaches, and data security is also a significant concern. In this paper, we propose a self-instruction based fine-tuning approach for fact-checking that balances accuracy and explainability. Our method consists of Data Augmentation and Improved DPO fine-tuning. The former starts by instructing the model to generate both positive and negative explanations based on claim-evidence pairs and labels, then sampling the dataset according to our customized difficulty standards. The latter employs our proposed improved DPO to fine-tune the model using the generated samples. We fine-tune the smallest-scale LLaMA-7B model and evaluate it on the challenging fact-checking datasets FEVEROUS and HOVER, utilizing four fine-tuning methods and three few-shot learning methods for comparison.

The conversion of these measurements to the spatial frame of the plasma is a great challenge, but required for direct comparison of the measurements with MHD turbulence theories. Here we present a toolkit, based on the synthetic modeling of solar wind fluctuations as two-dimensional noise maps with adjustable spectral and power anisotropy, that can help with the temporal-spatial conversion of real data. Specifically, by following the spacecraft trajectory through a noise map (relative velocity and angle relative to some mean magnetic field) with properties tuned to mimic those of the solar wind, the likelihood that the temporal data fluctuations represent parallel or perpendicular fluctuations in the plasma frame can be quantified by correlating structure functions of the noise map. Synthetic temporal data can also be generated, which can provide a testing ground for analysis applied to the solar wind data. We demonstrate this tool by investigating Parker Solar Probe's E7 trajectory and data, and showcase several possible ways in which it can be used. We find that whether temporal variations in the spacecraft frame come from parallel or perpendicular variations in the plasma frame strongly depends on the spectral and power anisotropy of the measured wind.

Existing multi-RIS works mainly focus on link-level optimization with predetermined transmission paths, which cannot be directly extended to system-level management, since they neither consider the interference caused by undesired scattering of RISs, nor the performance balancing between different transmission paths. To address this, we study an innovative multi-hop multi-RIS communication system, where a base station (BS) transmits information to a set of distributed users over multi-RIS configuration space in a multi-hop manner.

Traditional model-level explanation methods like XGNN and GNNInterpreter often fail to identify valid substructures like rings, leading to questionable interpretability. This limitation stems from XGNN's atom-by-atom approach and GNNInterpreter's reliance on average graph embeddings, which overlook the essential structural elements crucial for molecules. To address these gaps, we introduce an innovative \\textbf{M}otif-b\\textbf{A}sed \\textbf{G}NN \\textbf{E}xplainer (MAGE) that uses motifs as fundamental units for generating explanations. Our approach begins with extracting potential motifs through a motif decomposition technique. Then, we utilize an attention-based learning method to identify class-specific motifs.

{"created":"2024-05-21 05:54:27","title":"Fully Randomized Pointers","abstract":"Software security continues to be a critical concern for programs implemented in low-level programming languages such as C and C++. Many defenses have been proposed in the current literature, each with different trade-offs including performance, compatibility, and attack resistance. One general class of defense is pointer randomization or authentication, where invalid object access (e.g., memory errors) is obfuscated or denied. Many defenses rely on the program termination (e.g., crashing) to abort attacks, with the implicit assumption that an adversary cannot \"brute force\" the defense with multiple attack attempts. However, such assumptions do not always hold, such as hardware speculative execution attacks or network servers configured to restart on error. In such cases, we argue that most existing defenses provide only weak effective security.   In this paper, we propose Fully Randomized Pointers (FRP) as a stronger memory error defense that is resistant to even brute force attacks. The key idea is to fully randomize pointer bits -- as much as possible while also preserving binary compatibility -- rendering the relationships between pointers highly unpredictable. Furthermore, the very high degree of randomization renders brute force attacks impractical -- providing strong effective security compared to existing work. We design a new FRP encoding that is: (1) compatible with existing binary code (without recompilation); (2) decoupled from the underlying object layout; and (3) can be efficiently decoded on-the-fly to the underlying memory address. We prototype FRP in the form of a software implementation (BlueFat) to test security and compatibility, and a proof-of-concept hardware implementation (GreenFat) to evaluate performance. We show that FRP is secure, practical, and compatible at the binary level, while a hardware implementation can achieve low performance overheads (<10%).","sentences":["Software security continues to be a critical concern for programs implemented in low-level programming languages such as C and C++.","Many defenses have been proposed in the current literature, each with different trade-offs including performance, compatibility, and attack resistance.","One general class of defense is pointer randomization or authentication, where invalid object access (e.g., memory errors) is obfuscated or denied.","Many defenses rely on the program termination (e.g., crashing) to abort attacks, with the implicit assumption that an adversary cannot \"brute force\" the defense with multiple attack attempts.","However, such assumptions do not always hold, such as hardware speculative execution attacks or network servers configured to restart on error.","In such cases, we argue that most existing defenses provide only weak effective security.

With the advance of deep learning, deep Outlier Detection (OD) has received broad interest. Most deep UOD models are trained exclusively on clean datasets to learn the distribution of the normal data, which requires huge manual efforts to clean the real-world data if possible. Instead of relying on clean datasets, some approaches directly train and detect on unlabeled contaminated datasets, leading to the need for methods that are robust to such conditions. Ensemble methods emerged as a superior solution to enhance model robustness against contaminated training sets. However, the training time is greatly increased by the ensemble.   In this study, we investigate the impact of outliers on the training phase, aiming to halt training on unlabeled contaminated datasets before performance degradation. Initially, we noted that blending normal and anomalous data causes AUC fluctuations, a label-dependent measure of detection accuracy. To circumvent the need for labels, we propose a zero-label entropy metric named Loss Entropy for loss distribution, enabling us to infer optimal stopping points for training without labels. Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate negative correlation between entropy metric and the label-based AUC. Based on this, we develop an automated early-stopping algorithm, EntropyStop, which halts training when loss entropy suggests the maximum model detection capability. We conduct extensive experiments on ADBench (including 47 real datasets), and the overall results indicate that AutoEncoder (AE) enhanced by our approach not only achieves better performance than ensemble AEs but also requires under 1\\% of training time.

We show that equilibrium dynamical fluctuation-dissipation relations between response and correlations are violated, both at the local and at the global level. The amount of violation peaks at the ordering transition, exactly as for the entropy production rate. Entropy is always produced locally and connected to the local fluctuation-dissipation violation via Harada-Sasa relationships.

Current methods typically demand extensive computational resources and training time, and require additional human annotations such as predefined parametric models, camera poses, and key points, limiting their generalizability. We propose Synergistic Shape and Skeleton Optimization (S3O), a novel two-phase method that forgoes these prerequisites and efficiently learns parametric models including visible shapes and underlying skeletons. Conventional strategies typically learn all parameters simultaneously, leading to interdependencies where a single incorrect prediction can result in significant errors. In contrast, S3O adopts a phased approach: it first focuses on learning coarse parametric models, then progresses to motion learning and detail addition. This method substantially lowers computational complexity and enhances robustness in reconstruction from limited viewpoints, all without requiring additional annotations. To address the current inadequacies in 3D reconstruction from monocular video benchmarks, we collected the PlanetZoo dataset. Our experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks and the PlanetZoo dataset affirm that S3O provides more accurate 3D reconstruction, and plausible skeletons, and reduces the training time by approximately 60% compared to the state-of-the-art, thus advancing the state of the art in dynamic object reconstruction.","sentences":["Reconstructing dynamic articulated objects from a singular monocular video is challenging, requiring joint estimation of shape, motion, and camera parameters from limited views.","Current methods typically demand extensive computational resources and training time, and require additional human annotations such as predefined parametric models, camera poses, and key points, limiting their generalizability.","We propose Synergistic Shape and Skeleton Optimization (S3O), a novel two-phase method that forgoes these prerequisites and efficiently learns parametric models including visible shapes and underlying skeletons.","Conventional strategies typically learn all parameters simultaneously, leading to interdependencies where a single incorrect prediction can result in significant errors.","In contrast, S3O adopts a phased approach: it first focuses on learning coarse parametric models, then progresses to motion learning and detail addition.","This method substantially lowers computational complexity and enhances robustness in reconstruction from limited viewpoints, all without requiring additional annotations.","To address the current inadequacies in 3D reconstruction from monocular video benchmarks, we collected the PlanetZoo dataset.","Our experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks and the PlanetZoo dataset affirm that S3O provides more accurate 3D reconstruction, and plausible skeletons, and reduces the training time by approximately 60% compared to the state-of-the-art, thus advancing the state of the art in dynamic object reconstruction."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12607v1","category":"cs.CV"}

A critical challenge in affordance grounding is that the embodied agent should understand human instructions and analyze which tools in the environment can be used, as well as how to use these tools to accomplish the instructions. Most recent works primarily supports simple action labels as input instructions for localizing affordance regions, failing to capture complex human objectives. Moreover, these approaches typically identify affordance regions of only a single object in object-centric images, ignoring the object context and struggling to localize affordance regions of multiple objects in complex scenes for practical applications. To address this concern, for the first time, we introduce a new task of affordance grounding based on natural language instructions, extending it from previously using simple labels for complex human instructions. For this new task, we propose a new framework, WorldAfford. We design a novel Affordance Reasoning Chain-of-Thought Prompting to reason about affordance knowledge from LLMs more precisely and logically. Subsequently, we use SAM and CLIP to localize the objects related to the affordance knowledge in the image. We identify the affordance regions of the objects through an affordance region localization module. To benchmark this new task and validate our framework, an affordance grounding dataset, LLMaFF, is constructed. We conduct extensive experiments to verify that WorldAfford performs state-of-the-art on both the previous AGD20K and the new LLMaFF dataset.

However, building general-purpose HAR models that can be deployed to new smart home environments requires a significant amount of annotated sensor data and training overhead. Most smart homes vary significantly in their layouts, i.e., floor plans and the specifics of sensors embedded, resulting in low generalizability of HAR models trained for specific homes. We address this limitation by introducing a novel, layout-agnostic modeling approach for HAR systems in smart homes that utilizes the transferrable representational capacity of natural language descriptions of raw sensor data. To this end, we generate Textual Descriptions Of Sensor Triggers (TDOST) that encapsulate the surrounding trigger conditions and provide cues for underlying activities to the activity recognition models. Leveraging textual embeddings, rather than raw sensor data, we create activity recognition systems that predict standard activities across homes without either (re-)training or adaptation on target homes. Through an extensive evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TDOST-based models in unseen smart homes through experiments on benchmarked CASAS datasets.

Unfortunately, aspiration is frequently unsuccessful in extracting more challenging clots, which can become corked in the distal tip. We hypothesize that clot extraction can be enhanced by using histotripsy to degrade the mechanical integrity of clot material within the lumen of a hollow cylindrical transducer which can be situated at the tip of an aspiration catheter. To demonstrate the feasibility of degrading clot material within the lumen of a hollow cylindrical transducer, the effect of pulsing schemes on lesion generation within clots was assessed using a retracted clot model. A radially polarized cylindrical transducer (2.5 mm and 3.3 mm for inner and outer diameter, 2.5 mm length, PZT) working at 6.1 MHz was used to degrade retracted porcine clots with pulse lengths of 10, 20, and 100 us, pulse repetition frequencies (PRF) of 100, 500, and 1000 Hz, using treatment times from 0.1 to 10 seconds (n = 5 clots per condition). 3D ultrasound scans and bisected optical examinations of treated clots confirmed the formation of liquified zones. Lesions could form within 0.1 seconds along the central axis of the transducer and then grow in diameter and length over time. The lesion volume was found to be highly dependent on the exposure scheme, with the largest lesion volume associated with the 10 us pulse length 1000 kHz PRF case.

Since no analytical expressions of performance metrics are available for non-exponential systems, we use neural network surrogate models to calculate those performance metrics as functions in terms of the system parameters.

However, prevalent double-stream networks in multispectral detection employ two separate feature extraction branches for multi-modal data, leading to nearly double the inference time compared to single-stream networks utilizing only one feature extraction branch. This increased inference time has hindered the widespread employment of multispectral pedestrian detection in embedded devices for autonomous systems. To address this limitation, various knowledge distillation methods have been proposed. However, traditional distillation methods focus only on the fusion features and ignore the large amount of information in the original multi-modal features, thereby restricting the student network's performance.

In these models, a decision-maker observes the state of a stochastic process and determines which action to take with the goal of maximizing the expected total discounted rewards received. In many applications, the state space of the true system is large and there may be limited observations out of certain states to estimate the transition probability matrix. To overcome this, modelers will aggregate the true states into ``superstates\" resulting in a smaller state space. This aggregation process improves computational tractability and increases the number of observations among superstates. Thus, the modeler's choice of state space leads to a trade-off in transition probability estimates. While coarser discretization of the state space gives more observations in each state to estimate the transition probability matrix, this comes at the cost of precision in the state characterization and resulting policy recommendations. In this paper, we consider the implications of this modeling decision on the resulting policies from MDPs for which the true model is expected to have a threshold policy that is optimal.

Interestingly, perturbation-based model-free extremum seeking has a negative Jacobian, in the average, meaning that its (practical) convergence is exponential, even though the map's Hessian is zero at the extremum. While these observations for the gradient algorithm are not trivial, we focus in this paper on an even more nontrivial study of the same phenomenon for Newton-based extremum seeking control (NESC).

We first perform the meta-analysis of past comparative analyses to identify the factors led previously to inconsistent conclusions. We then demonstrate the new framework by comparing five reactor types. Significant findings are that (1) the repository footprint is neither linearly related to SNF volume nor to decay heat, due to the repository's thermal constraint, (2) fast reactors have significantly higher I-129 inventory, which is often the primarily dose contributor from repositories, and (3) the repository performance primarily depends on the waste forms.

Low subpacketization level coded caching schemes are desirable for practical implementations.

In particular, gas giants on close orbits are not predicted by planet formation theory and so some process(es) are thought to move the planets closer to their host stars. Recent research has suggested that Hot Jupiter host stars display a different phase space compared to stars that do not host Hot Jupiters. This has been attributed to these stars forming in star-forming regions of high stellar density, where dynamical interactions with passing stars have perturbed the planets. We test this hypothesis by quantifying the phase space of planet-hosting stars in dynamical N-body simulations of star-forming regions. We find that stars that retain their planets have a higher phase space than non-hosts, regardless of their initial physical density. This is because an imprint of the kinematic substructure from the regions birth is retained, as these stars have experienced fewer and less disruptive encounters than stars whose planets have been liberated and become free-floating. However, host stars whose planets remain bound but have had their orbits significantly altered by dynamical encounters are also primarily found in high phase space regimes. We therefore corroborate other research in this area which has suggested the high phase space of Hot Jupiter host stars is not caused by dynamical encounters or stellar clustering, but rather reflects an age bias in that these stars are (kinematically) younger than other exoplanet host stars.","sentences":["The architectures of extrasolar planetary systems often deviate considerably from the ``standard\" model for planet formation, which is largely based on our own Solar System.","In particular, gas giants on close orbits are not predicted by planet formation theory and so some process(es) are thought to move the planets closer to their host stars.","Recent research has suggested that Hot Jupiter host stars display a different phase space compared to stars that do not host Hot Jupiters.","This has been attributed to these stars forming in star-forming regions of high stellar density, where dynamical interactions with passing stars have perturbed the planets.","We test this hypothesis by quantifying the phase space of planet-hosting stars in dynamical N-body simulations of star-forming regions.","We find that stars that retain their planets have a higher phase space than non-hosts, regardless of their initial physical density.","This is because an imprint of the kinematic substructure from the regions birth is retained, as these stars have experienced fewer and less disruptive encounters than stars whose planets have been liberated and become free-floating.","However, host stars whose planets remain bound but have had their orbits significantly altered by dynamical encounters are also primarily found in high phase space regimes.","We therefore corroborate other research in this area which has suggested the high phase space of Hot Jupiter host stars is not caused by dynamical encounters or stellar clustering, but rather reflects an age bias in that these stars are (kinematically) younger than other exoplanet host stars."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12741v1","category":"astro-ph.SR"}

{"created":"2024-05-21 10:36:27","title":"Constraints on the (re-)orientation of star-disk systems through infall","abstract":"It has been consensus that star-disk systems accrete most of their mass and angular momentum during the collapse of a prestellar core, such that the rotational direction of a system is equivalent to the net rotation of the core. Recent results, however, indicate that stars experience post-collapse or late infall, during which the star and its disk is refreshed with material from the protostellar environment through accretion streamers. Apart from adding mass to the star-disk system, infall potentially supplies a substantial amount of angular momentum as the infalling material is initially not bound to the collapsing prestellar core. We investigate the orientation of infall on star-disk systems by analyzing the properties of accreting tracer particles in 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations of a molecular cloud that is (4 pc)$^3$ in volume. In contrast to the traditional picture, where the rotational axis is inherited from the collapse of a coherent pre-stellar core, the orientation of star-disk systems can change substantially during the accretion process. In agreement with previous results that show larger contributions of late infall for increasing stellar masses, infall is more likely to lead to a prolonged change in orientation for stars of higher final mass. On average, brown dwarfs and very low mass stars are more likely to form and accrete all of their mass as part of a multiple system, while stars with final masses above a few 0.1 M$_{\\odot}$ are more likely to accrete part of their mass as single stars. Finally, we find an overall trend: the post-collapse accretion phase is more anisotropic than the early collapse phase. This result is consistent with a scenario, where mass accretion from infall occurs via infalling streamers along a preferred direction, while the initial collapse is less anisotropic albeit the fact that material is funneled through accretion channels.","sentences":["It has been consensus that star-disk systems accrete most of their mass and angular momentum during the collapse of a prestellar core, such that the rotational direction of a system is equivalent to the net rotation of the core.","Recent results, however, indicate that stars experience post-collapse or late infall, during which the star and its disk is refreshed with material from the protostellar environment through accretion streamers.","Apart from adding mass to the star-disk system, infall potentially supplies a substantial amount of angular momentum as the infalling material is initially not bound to the collapsing prestellar core.","We investigate the orientation of infall on star-disk systems by analyzing the properties of accreting tracer particles in 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations of a molecular cloud that is (4 pc)$^3$ in volume.","In contrast to the traditional picture, where the rotational axis is inherited from the collapse of a coherent pre-stellar core, the orientation of star-disk systems can change substantially during the accretion process.","In agreement with previous results that show larger contributions of late infall for increasing stellar masses, infall is more likely to lead to a prolonged change in orientation for stars of higher final mass.","On average, brown dwarfs and very low mass stars are more likely to form and accrete all of their mass as part of a multiple system, while stars with final masses above a few 0.1 M$_{\\odot}$ are more likely to accrete part of their mass as single stars.","Finally, we find an overall trend: the post-collapse accretion phase is more anisotropic than the early collapse phase.","This result is consistent with a scenario, where mass accretion from infall occurs via infalling streamers along a preferred direction, while the initial collapse is less anisotropic albeit the fact that material is funneled through accretion channels."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12670v1","category":"astro-ph.SR"}

The longwave asymptotic expansion technique is utilized to formulate a single nonlinear free surface deflection equation. The linear stability criteria for the onset of instability are derived using the normal mode form in the linearized portion of the surface deformation equation. Linear stability theory reveals that the flow-directed sturdy external shear grows the surface wave instability by increasing the net driving force. On the contrary, the upstream-directed imposed shear may reduce the surface mode instability by restricting the gravity-driving force, which has the consequence of weakening the bulk velocity of the liquid film. However, the surface mode can be stabilized/destabilized by increasing the temperature-dependent density/surface-tension variation. Further, the bottom steepness shows dual behaviour on the surface instability depending upon the wavy wall's portion (uphill/downhill). At the downhill portion, the surface wave becomes more unstable than at the bottom substrate's uphill portion. Moreover, the multi-scale method is incorporated to obtain the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation in order to study the weakly nonlinear stability, confirming the existence of various flow regions of the liquid film. At any bottom portion (uphill/downhill), the flow-directed external shear expands the super-critical stable zones, which causes an amplification in the nonlinear wave amplitude, and the backflow-directed shear plays a counterproductive role.

The goal of this paper is to constrain the orbit of V892 Tau NE and to determine the resulting circumbinary disc dynamics. We present new ALMA observations of the V892 Tau circumbinary disc at a twice higher angular and spectral resolution. We model the data with V892 Tau as a triple system and perform a grid of hydrodynamical simulations testing several orbits of the companion. The simulation outputs are then post-processed to build synthetic maps that we compare to the observations. The 12CO emission of the disc shows clear non-Keplerian features such as spiral arms. When comparing the data with our synthetic observations, we interpret these features as ongoing interactions with the companion. Our simulations indicate that an eccentricity of 0.5 of the companion is needed to reproduce the observed disc extent and that a mutual inclination of approximately 60{\\deg} with the inner binary reproduces the measured disc tilt.

WST is a 12-metre wide-field spectroscopic survey telescope with simultaneous operation of a large field-of-view (3 sq. degree), high-multiplex (20,000) multi-object spectrograph (MOS), with both a low and high-resolution modes, and a giant 3x3 arcmin2 integral field spectrograph (IFS). In scientific capability, these specifications place WST far ahead of existing and planned facilities. In only 5 years of operation, the MOS would target 250 million galaxies and 25 million stars at low spectral resolution, plus 2 million stars at high resolution. Without need for pre-imaged targets, the IFS would deliver 4 billion spectra offering many serendipitous discoveries. Given the current investment in deep imaging surveys and noting the diagnostic power of spectroscopy, WST will fill a crucial gap in astronomical capability and work in synergy with future ground and space-based facilities. We show how it can address outstanding scientific questions in the areas of cosmology; galaxy assembly, evolution, and enrichment, including our own Milky Way; the origin of stars and planets; and time domain and multi-messenger astrophysics.

Economic model predictive control holds the promise of enhancing the overall operational performance of the water treatment facilities. In this study, we propose a data-driven economic predictive control approach within the Koopman modeling framework. First, we propose a deep learning-enabled input-output Koopman modeling approach, which predicts the overall economic operational cost of the wastewater treatment process based on input data and available output measurements that are directly linked to the operational costs. Subsequently, by leveraging this learned input-output Koopman model, a convex economic predictive control scheme is developed.

This is done using matched asymptotic expansion, which consists here in introducing different asymptotic expansions of the solution in three subdomains: the vicinity of the corner, the layer and the rest of the domain. These expansions are linked through matching conditions. The presence of the corner makes these matching conditions delicate to derive because the fields have singular behaviors. Our approach is to reformulate these matching conditions purely algebraically by writing all asymptotic expansions as formal series.

The advent of large-scale missions such as Gaia is reshaping our understanding or stellar kinematics in the Solar neighborhood and beyond, and offers the opportunity to detect a large number of loose, coeval stellar associations for the first time, which evaded prior detection because of their low density or the faintness of their members.

However, this small subset often leads to error propagation from the bi-encoders, thereby restricting the performance of the overall pipeline. To address these issues, we propose the Comparing Multiple Candidates (CMC) framework, which compares a query and multiple candidate embeddings jointly through shallow self-attention layers. While providing contextualized representations, CMC is scalable enough to handle multiple comparisons simultaneously, where comparing 2K candidates takes only twice as long as comparing 100. Practitioners can use CMC as a lightweight and effective reranker to improve top-1 accuracy. Moreover, when integrated with another retriever, CMC reranking can function as a virtually enhanced retriever. This configuration adds only negligible latency compared to using a single retriever (virtual), while significantly improving recall at K (enhanced).} Through experiments, we demonstrate that CMC, as a virtually enhanced retriever, significantly improves Recall@k (+6.7, +3.5%-p for R@16, R@64) compared to the initial retrieval stage on the ZeSHEL dataset. Meanwhile, we conduct experiments for direct reranking on entity, passage, and dialogue ranking.

Anal., 61, 2859--2886, 2023). The pressure velocity coupling and the viscous terms are treated implicitly, while the convection term is treated explicitly using extrapolation. Herein we focus on the implicit-explicit Crank-Nicolson method for time discretization. For the discretization in space we consider finite element methods with stabilization on the gradient jumps. The stabilizing terms ensures inf-sup stability for equal order interpolation and robustness at high Reynolds number. Under suitable Courant conditions we prove stability of the implicit-explicit Crank-Nicolson scheme in this regime.

Standard eddy identification methods are usually based on deterministic optimal point estimates of the ocean flow field, which produce a single best estimate without accounting for inherent uncertainties in the data. However, large uncertainty exists in estimating the flow field due to the use of noisy, sparse, and indirect observations, as well as turbulent flow models. When this uncertainty is overlooked, the accuracy of eddy identification is significantly affected. This paper presents a general probabilistic eddy identification framework that adapts existing methods to incorporate uncertainty into the diagnostic. The framework begins by sampling an ensemble of ocean realizations from the probabilistic state estimation, which considers uncertainty. Traditional eddy diagnostics are then applied to individual realizations, and the corresponding eddy statistics are aggregated from these diagnostic results. The framework is applied to a scenario mimicking the Beaufort Gyre marginal ice zone, where large uncertainty appears in estimating the ocean field using Lagrangian data assimilation with sparse ice floe trajectories. The probabilistic eddy identification precisely characterizes the contribution from the turbulent fluctuations and provides additional insights in comparison to its deterministic counterpart. The skills in counting the number of eddies and computing the probability of the eddy are both significantly improved under the probabilistic framework. Notably, large biases appear when estimating the eddy lifetime using deterministic methods. In contrast, probabilistic eddy identification not only provides a closer estimate but also quantifies the uncertainty in inferring such a crucial dynamical quantity.","sentences":["Mesoscale eddies are critical in ocean circulation and the global climate system.","Standard eddy identification methods are usually based on deterministic optimal point estimates of the ocean flow field, which produce a single best estimate without accounting for inherent uncertainties in the data.","However, large uncertainty exists in estimating the flow field due to the use of noisy, sparse, and indirect observations, as well as turbulent flow models.","When this uncertainty is overlooked, the accuracy of eddy identification is significantly affected.","This paper presents a general probabilistic eddy identification framework that adapts existing methods to incorporate uncertainty into the diagnostic.","The framework begins by sampling an ensemble of ocean realizations from the probabilistic state estimation, which considers uncertainty.","Traditional eddy diagnostics are then applied to individual realizations, and the corresponding eddy statistics are aggregated from these diagnostic results.","The framework is applied to a scenario mimicking the Beaufort Gyre marginal ice zone, where large uncertainty appears in estimating the ocean field using Lagrangian data assimilation with sparse ice floe trajectories.","The probabilistic eddy identification precisely characterizes the contribution from the turbulent fluctuations and provides additional insights in comparison to its deterministic counterpart.","The skills in counting the number of eddies and computing the probability of the eddy are both significantly improved under the probabilistic framework.","Notably, large biases appear when estimating the eddy lifetime using deterministic methods.","In contrast, probabilistic eddy identification not only provides a closer estimate but also quantifies the uncertainty in inferring such a crucial dynamical quantity."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12342v1","category":"math.DS"}

{"created":"2024-05-20 18:12:36","title":"Continual Deep Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Satellite Routing","abstract":"This paper introduces a full solution for decentralized routing in Low Earth Orbit satellite constellations based on continual Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). This requires addressing multiple challenges, including the partial knowledge at the satellites and their continuous movement, and the time-varying sources of uncertainty in the system, such as traffic, communication links, or communication buffers. We follow a multi-agent approach, where each satellite acts as an independent decision-making agent, while acquiring a limited knowledge of the environment based on the feedback received from the nearby agents. The solution is divided into two phases. First, an offline learning phase relies on decentralized decisions and a global Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained with global experiences. Then, the online phase with local, on-board, and pre-trained DNNs requires continual learning to evolve with the environment, which can be done in two different ways: (1) Model anticipation, where the predictable conditions of the constellation are exploited by each satellite sharing local model with the next satellite; and (2) Federated Learning (FL), where each agent's model is merged first at the cluster level and then aggregated in a global Parameter Server. The results show that, without high congestion, the proposed Multi-Agent DRL framework achieves the same E2E performance as a shortest-path solution, but the latter assumes intensive communication overhead for real-time network-wise knowledge of the system at a centralized node, whereas ours only requires limited feedback exchange among first neighbour satellites. Importantly, our solution adapts well to congestion conditions and exploits less loaded paths. Moreover, the divergence of models over time is easily tackled by the synergy between anticipation, applied in short-term alignment, and FL, utilized for long-term alignment.","sentences":["This paper introduces a full solution for decentralized routing in Low Earth Orbit satellite constellations based on continual Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL).","This requires addressing multiple challenges, including the partial knowledge at the satellites and their continuous movement, and the time-varying sources of uncertainty in the system, such as traffic, communication links, or communication buffers.","We follow a multi-agent approach, where each satellite acts as an independent decision-making agent, while acquiring a limited knowledge of the environment based on the feedback received from the nearby agents.","The solution is divided into two phases.","First, an offline learning phase relies on decentralized decisions and a global Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained with global experiences.","Then, the online phase with local, on-board, and pre-trained DNNs requires continual learning to evolve with the environment, which can be done in two different ways: (1) Model anticipation, where the predictable conditions of the constellation are exploited by each satellite sharing local model with the next satellite; and (2) Federated Learning (FL), where each agent's model is merged first at the cluster level and then aggregated in a global Parameter Server.","The results show that, without high congestion, the proposed Multi-Agent DRL framework achieves the same E2E performance as a shortest-path solution, but the latter assumes intensive communication overhead for real-time network-wise knowledge of the system at a centralized node, whereas ours only requires limited feedback exchange among first neighbour satellites.","Importantly, our solution adapts well to congestion conditions and exploits less loaded paths.","Moreover, the divergence of models over time is easily tackled by the synergy between anticipation, applied in short-term alignment, and FL, utilized for long-term alignment."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12308v1","category":"cs.LG"}

Estimating EP, however, is challenging both theoretically and experimentally due to limited access to the system dynamics. For overdamped Langevin dynamics and Markov jump processes it was recently proposed that, from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TUR), short-time cumulant currents can be used to estimate EP without knowledge of the dynamics. Yet, estimation of EP in underdamped Langevin systems remains an active challenge. To address this, we derive a modified TUR that relates the statistics of two specific novel currents -- one cumulant current and one stochastic current -- to a system's EP. These two distinct but related currents are used to constrain EP in the modified TUR. One highlight is that there always exists a family of currents such that the uncertainty relations saturate, even for long-time averages and in nonsteady-state scenarios. Another is that our method only requires limited knowledge of the dynamics -- specifically, the damping-coefficient to mass ratio and the diffusion constant.

We consider a globally averaged reionisation history and implement fully ionised cavities (HII bubbles) of diameters $d$ ranging from 0.01 Mpc to 10 Mpc at epochs within the emission and the absorption regimes of the 21-cm global signal. The single-ray C21LRT calculations show that the shape of the imprinted spectral features are primarily determined by $d$ and the 21-cm line profile, which is parametrised by the turbulent velocity of the HI gas. It reveals the spectral features tied to the transition from ionised to neutral regions that calculations based on the optical depth parametrisation were unable to capture. We also present analytical approximations of the calculated spectral features of the HII bubbles.

{"created":"2024-05-20 17:45:36","title":"Modeling citation worthiness by using attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory networks and interpretable models","abstract":"Scientist learn early on how to cite scientific sources to support their claims. Sometimes, however, scientists have challenges determining where a citation should be situated -- or, even worse, fail to cite a source altogether. Automatically detecting sentences that need a citation (i.e., citation worthiness) could solve both of these issues, leading to more robust and well-constructed scientific arguments. Previous researchers have applied machine learning to this task but have used small datasets and models that do not take advantage of recent algorithmic developments such as attention mechanisms in deep learning. We hypothesize that we can develop significantly accurate deep learning architectures that learn from large supervised datasets constructed from open access publications. In this work, we propose a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with attention mechanism and contextual information to detect sentences that need citations. We also produce a new, large dataset (PMOA-CITE) based on PubMed Open Access Subset, which is orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets. Our experiments show that our architecture achieves state of the art performance on the standard ACL-ARC dataset ($F_{1}=0.507$) and exhibits high performance ($F_{1}=0.856$) on the new PMOA-CITE. Moreover, we show that it can transfer learning across these datasets. We further use interpretable models to illuminate how specific language is used to promote and inhibit citations.

Despite the growing application of Physical Information Neural Networks (PINNs) in hydrodynamic lubrication analysis, their use has been primarily limited to smooth surfaces. This is due to traditional PINN methods suffer from spectral bias, favoring to learn low-frequency features and thus failing to analyze rough surfaces with high-frequency signals.

To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a novel multi-scale lubrication neural network architecture that utilizes a trainable Fourier feature network. By incorporating learnable feature embedding frequencies, this architecture automatically adapts to various frequency components, thereby enhancing the analysis of rough surface characteristics. This method has been tested across multiple surface morphologies, and the results have been compared with those obtained using the finite element method (FEM). The comparative analysis demonstrates that this approach achieves a high consistency with FEM results.

Recent studies demonstrate that vision transformer-based methods have significantly improved performance in medical image segmentation, primarily due to their superior ability to establish global relationships among features and adaptability to various inputs. However, these methods struggle with the low signal-to-noise ratio inherent to medical images. Additionally, the effective utilization of channel and spatial information, which are essential for medical image segmentation, is limited by the representation capacity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-dimension transformer with attention-based filtering (MDT-AF), which redesigns the patch embedding and self-attention mechanism for medical image segmentation. MDT-AF incorporates an attention-based feature filtering mechanism into the patch embedding blocks and employs a coarse-to-fine process to mitigate the impact of low signal-to-noise ratio.

By combining both mechanisms, the proposed mechanism enables the model to better capture complex patterns and relationships between various features, leading to improved segmentation accuracy and better feature representation. Furthermore, an attention gating mechanism is employed to integrate attention information with encoder features, allowing the model to adaptively weigh the importance of different attention features and ignore irrelevant ones.

The proposed framework employs a loss function inspired by the finite element method (FEM) with the implicit Euler time integration scheme. A transient thermal conduction problem is considered to benchmark the performance. The proposed operator learning framework takes a temperature field at the current time step as input and predicts a temperature field at the next time step. The Galerkin discretized weak formulation of the heat equation is employed to incorporate physics into the loss function, which is coined finite operator learning (FOL). Upon training, the networks successfully predict the temperature evolution over time for any initial temperature field at high accuracy compared to the FEM solution. The framework is also confirmed to be applicable to a heterogeneous thermal conductivity and arbitrary geometry. The advantages of FOL can be summarized as follows: First, the training is performed in an unsupervised manner, avoiding the need for a large data set prepared from costly simulations or experiments. Instead, random temperature patterns generated by the Gaussian random process and the Fourier series, combined with constant temperature fields, are used as training data to cover possible temperature cases. Second, shape functions and backward difference approximation are exploited for the domain discretization, resulting in a purely algebraic equation. This enhances training efficiency, as one avoids time-consuming automatic differentiation when optimizing weights and biases while accepting possible discretization errors.

Methods: A 7-layer neural network called DCE-Qnet was trained on simulated DCE-MRI signals derived from the Extended Tofts model with the Parker arterial input function. Network training incorporated B1 inhomogeneities to estimate perfusion (Ktrans, vp, ve), tissue T1 relaxation, proton density and bolus arrival time (BAT). The accuracy was tested in a digital phantom in comparison to a conventional nonlinear least-squares fitting (NLSQ). In vivo testing was conducted in 10 healthy subjects. Regions of interest in the cervix and uterine myometrium were used to calculate the inter-subject variability. The clinical utility was demonstrated on a cervical cancer patient. Test-retest experiments were used to assess reproducibility of the parameter maps in the tumor.   Results: The DCE-Qnet reconstruction outperformed NLSQ in the phantom. The coefficient of variation (CV) in the healthy cervix varied between 5-51% depending on the parameter. Parameter values in the tumor agreed with previous studies despite differences in methodology. The CV in the tumor varied between 1-47%.   Conclusion: The proposed approach provides comprehensive DCE-MRI quantification from a single acquisition.

The equations of EC theory are rewritten such that they formally resemble those of Einstein General Relativity (EGR); this allows ideas from post-Newtonian theory to be imported without essential change. The equations of motion are then written both at first post-Newtonian (1PN) order and at 1.5PN order. EC theory's 1PN equations of motion are found to be those of a micropolar/Cosserat elastic medium, along with a decoupled evolution equation for non-classical, spin-related fields.

The core of multi-domain recommendation is effectively modeling the commonalities and distinctions among domains. Existing works are dedicated to designing model architectures for implicit multi-domain modeling while overlooking an in-depth investigation from a more fundamental perspective of feature distributions. This paper focuses on features with significant differences across various domains in both distributions and effects on model predictions. We refer to these features as domain-sensitive features, which serve as carriers of domain distinctions and are crucial for multi-domain modeling. Experiments demonstrate that existing multi-domain modeling methods may neglect domain-sensitive features, indicating insufficient learning of domain distinctions. To avoid this neglect, we propose a domain-sensitive feature attribution method to identify features that best reflect domain distinctions from the feature set. Further, we design a memory architecture that extracts domain-specific information from domain-sensitive features for the model to retrieve and integrate, thereby enhancing the awareness of domain distinctions. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in capturing domain distinctions and improving multi-domain recommendation performance.","sentences":["With the increase in the business scale and number of domains in online advertising, multi-domain ad recommendation has become a mainstream solution in the industry.","The core of multi-domain recommendation is effectively modeling the commonalities and distinctions among domains.","Existing works are dedicated to designing model architectures for implicit multi-domain modeling while overlooking an in-depth investigation from a more fundamental perspective of feature distributions.","This paper focuses on features with significant differences across various domains in both distributions and effects on model predictions.","We refer to these features as domain-sensitive features, which serve as carriers of domain distinctions and are crucial for multi-domain modeling.","Experiments demonstrate that existing multi-domain modeling methods may neglect domain-sensitive features, indicating insufficient learning of domain distinctions.","To avoid this neglect, we propose a domain-sensitive feature attribution method to identify features that best reflect domain distinctions from the feature set.","Further, we design a memory architecture that extracts domain-specific information from domain-sensitive features for the model to retrieve and integrate, thereby enhancing the awareness of domain distinctions.","Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in capturing domain distinctions and improving multi-domain recommendation performance."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12892v1","category":"cs.IR"}

While recent studies have primarily concentrated on addressing privacy leakage concerns in split learning, such as inference attacks and data reconstruction, the exploration of security issues (e.g., backdoor attacks) within the framework of split learning has been comparatively limited. Nonetheless, the security vulnerability within the context of split learning is highly posing a threat and can give rise to grave security implications, such as the illegal impersonation in the face recognition model. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a stealthy backdoor attack strategy (namely SBAT) tailored to the without-label-sharing split learning architecture, which unveils the inherent security vulnerability of split learning. We posit the existence of a potential attacker on the server side aiming to introduce a backdoor into the training model, while exploring two scenarios: one with known client network architecture and the other with unknown architecture. Diverging from traditional backdoor attack methods that manipulate the training data and labels, we constructively conduct the backdoor attack by injecting the trigger embedding into the server network. Specifically, our SBAT achieves a higher level of attack stealthiness by refraining from modifying any intermediate parameters (e.g., gradients) during training and instead executing all malicious operations post-training.","sentences":["As a novel privacy-preserving paradigm aimed at reducing client computational costs and achieving data utility, split learning has garnered extensive attention and proliferated widespread applications across various fields, including smart health and smart transportation, among others.","While recent studies have primarily concentrated on addressing privacy leakage concerns in split learning, such as inference attacks and data reconstruction, the exploration of security issues (e.g., backdoor attacks) within the framework of split learning has been comparatively limited.","Nonetheless, the security vulnerability within the context of split learning is highly posing a threat and can give rise to grave security implications, such as the illegal impersonation in the face recognition model.","Therefore, in this paper, we propose a stealthy backdoor attack strategy (namely SBAT) tailored to the without-label-sharing split learning architecture, which unveils the inherent security vulnerability of split learning.","We posit the existence of a potential attacker on the server side aiming to introduce a backdoor into the training model, while exploring two scenarios: one with known client network architecture and the other with unknown architecture.","Diverging from traditional backdoor attack methods that manipulate the training data and labels, we constructively conduct the backdoor attack by injecting the trigger embedding into the server network.","Specifically, our SBAT achieves a higher level of attack stealthiness by refraining from modifying any intermediate parameters (e.g., gradients) during training and instead executing all malicious operations post-training."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12751v1","category":"cs.CR"}

The key challenge in MDL lies in striking a balance between learning commonalities across domains while preserving the distinct characteristics of each domain. However, this gives rise to a challenging dilemma. On one hand, a model needs to leverage domain-specific modules, such as experts or embeddings, to preserve the uniqueness of each domain. On the other hand, due to the long-tailed distributions observed in real-world domains, some tail domains may lack sufficient samples to fully learn their corresponding modules. Unfortunately, existing approaches have not adequately addressed this dilemma. To address this issue, we propose a novel model called Crocodile, which stands for Cross-experts Covariance Loss for Disentangled Learning.

In addition, in most of the existing results, the distribution of the states of an ensemble of discrete-time systems is assumed to be Gaussian. However, in case the system parameters are uncertain, it is not always realistic to assume that the distribution of the system follows a Gaussian distribution, thus complicating the solution of the overall problem. In this paper, we address the general distribution steering problem for first-order discrete-time ensemble systems, where the distributions of the system parameters and the states are arbitrary with finite first few moments. Both linear and nonlinear system dynamics are considered using the method of power moments to transform the original infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one. We also propose a control law for the ensuing moment system, which allows us to obtain the power moments of the desired control inputs. Finally, we solve the inverse problem to obtain the feasible control inputs from their corresponding power moments. We provide numerical results to validate our theoretical developments. These include cases where the parameter distribution is uniform, Gaussian, non-Gaussian, and multi-modal, respectively.","sentences":["Ensemble systems appear frequently in many engineering applications and, as a result, they have become an important research topic in control theory.","These systems are best characterized by the evolution of their underlying state distribution.","Despite the work to date, few results exist dealing with the problem of directly modifying (i.e., \"steering\") the distribution of an ensemble system.","In addition, in most of the existing results, the distribution of the states of an ensemble of discrete-time systems is assumed to be Gaussian.","However, in case the system parameters are uncertain, it is not always realistic to assume that the distribution of the system follows a Gaussian distribution, thus complicating the solution of the overall problem.","In this paper, we address the general distribution steering problem for first-order discrete-time ensemble systems, where the distributions of the system parameters and the states are arbitrary with finite first few moments.","Both linear and nonlinear system dynamics are considered using the method of power moments to transform the original infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one.","We also propose a control law for the ensuing moment system, which allows us to obtain the power moments of the desired control inputs.","Finally, we solve the inverse problem to obtain the feasible control inputs from their corresponding power moments.","We provide numerical results to validate our theoretical developments.","These include cases where the parameter distribution is uniform, Gaussian, non-Gaussian, and multi-modal, respectively."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12415v1","category":"math.OC"}

Thanks to these data, targeting a northern region of the cluster and thus complementing our previous MUSE program on the cluster core, we release a new catalog containing 162 secure spectroscopic redshifts. We confirm 22 cluster members, which were previously only photometrically selected, and detect ten additional ones, resulting in a total of 308 secure members, of which 63% are spectroscopically confirmed. We further identify 17 new spectroscopic multiple images belonging to 6 different background sources. By exploiting MUSE data, in combination with the deep HFF images, we develop an improved total mass model of MACS J1149.5+2223. This model includes 308 total mass components for the member galaxies and requires four additional mass profiles, one of which is associated with a cluster galaxy overdensity identified in the North, representing the DM mass distribution on larger scales. The values of the resulting 34 free parameters are optimized based on the observed positions of 106 multiple images from 34 different families, that cover the redshift range between 1.240 and 5.983. Our final model has a multiple image position rms value of 0.39\", which is well in agreement with that of other cluster lens models. With this refined mass model, we pave the way towards even better strong-lensing analyses that will exploit the deep and high resolution observations with HST and JWST on a pixel level in the region of the supernova Refsdal host.

Runaway Stars as Fossils of Sub-Cluster Mergers","abstract":"Two main mechanisms have classically been proposed for the formation of runaway stars. The binary supernova scenario (BSS) suggests that a massive star in a binary explodes as a supernova, ejecting its companion. The dynamical ejection scenario suggests that a star is ejected through a strong dynamical encounter between multiple stars. We propose a third mechanism for the formation of runaway stars: the sub-cluster ejection scenario (SCES), where an infalling sub-cluster of stars is ejected out of the cluster by a slingshot interaction with the contracting gravitational potential of the assembling cluster. We demonstrate the SCES in a star-by-star simulation of a young massive cluster forming from a $10^6\\rm~M_\\odot$ gas cloud using the Torch framework. This star cluster forms hierarchically through a sequence of sub-cluster mergers, determined by the initial turbulent, spherical initial conditions of the gas. We find that these mergers drive the formation of runaway stars in our model. Late-forming sub-clusters fall into the central potential, where they are ejected on a slingshot trajectory, forming groups of runaway stars that are distributed highly anisotropically. Runaways formed by the same SCES share similar ages, velocities, and ejection directions. Surveying observations, we identify several SCES candidate groups with anisotropic ejection directions. The SCES is capable of producing runaway binaries: two wide dynamical binaries in infalling sub-clusters were tightened through ejection. This allows for another velocity kick via subsequent BSS, which is a promising avenue for producing hypervelocity stars unbound to the Galaxy. The SCES occurs when sub-cluster formation is resolved. We expect non-spherical initial gas distributions to increase runaway star numbers. The observation of groups of runaway stars formed via SCES thus reveals the assembly history of their natal clusters.","sentences":["Two main mechanisms have classically been proposed for the formation of runaway stars.","The binary supernova scenario (BSS) suggests that a massive star in a binary explodes as a supernova, ejecting its companion.","The dynamical ejection scenario suggests that a star is ejected through a strong dynamical encounter between multiple stars.","We propose a third mechanism for the formation of runaway stars: the sub-cluster ejection scenario (SCES), where an infalling sub-cluster of stars is ejected out of the cluster by a slingshot interaction with the contracting gravitational potential of the assembling cluster.","We demonstrate the SCES in a star-by-star simulation of a young massive cluster forming from a $10^6\\rm~M_\\odot$ gas cloud using the Torch framework.","This star cluster forms hierarchically through a sequence of sub-cluster mergers, determined by the initial turbulent, spherical initial conditions of the gas.","We find that these mergers drive the formation of runaway stars in our model.","Late-forming sub-clusters fall into the central potential, where they are ejected on a slingshot trajectory, forming groups of runaway stars that are distributed highly anisotropically.","Runaways formed by the same SCES share similar ages, velocities, and ejection directions.","Surveying observations, we identify several SCES candidate groups with anisotropic ejection directions.","The SCES is capable of producing runaway binaries: two wide dynamical binaries in infalling sub-clusters were tightened through ejection.","This allows for another velocity kick via subsequent BSS, which is a promising avenue for producing hypervelocity stars unbound to the Galaxy.","The SCES occurs when sub-cluster formation is resolved.","We expect non-spherical initial gas distributions to increase runaway star numbers.","The observation of groups of runaway stars formed via SCES thus reveals the assembly history of their natal clusters."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12286v1","category":"astro-ph.GA"}

As in antiferromagnets, magnons in altermagnets come in two flavours, that either add one or remove one unit of spin to the $S=0$ ground state. However, in altermagnets these two magnon modes are non-degenerate along some directions in reciprocal space.

{"created":"2024-05-21 08:24:38","title":"Spectral analysis for noisy Hawkes processes inference","abstract":"Classic estimation methods for Hawkes processes rely on the assumption that observed event times are indeed a realisation of a Hawkes process, without considering any potential perturbation of the model. However, in practice, observations are often altered by some noise, the form of which depends on the context.It is then required to model the alteration mechanism in order to infer accurately such a noisy Hawkes process. While several models exist, we consider, in this work, the observations to be the indistinguishable union of event times coming from a Hawkes process and from an independent Poisson process. Since standard inference methods (such as maximum likelihood or Expectation-Maximisation) are either unworkable or numerically prohibitive in this context, we propose an estimation procedure based on the spectral analysis of second order properties of the noisy Hawkes process. Novel results include sufficient conditions for identifiability of the ensuing statistical model with exponential interaction functions for both univariate and bivariate processes.

By ensuring plasmonic coupling in the pyramidal nanoparticle lattice, the achieved field intensity is potentiated. At the same time, a strong coupling between resonant modes is guaranteed, which results in the formation of new hybrid modes. In this manuscript, we demonstrated a tunable double anticrossing interaction that results from the interaction between two Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) modes and a Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) wave. The tuning is done as a function of the variation of the angle of incidence of the input electric field. From the double anticrossing, an increase in field intensity in a blue-shifted LSPR mode located in the red wavelength region is observed. This demonstrates that at certain angles of incidence, the intensity field obtained is strongly favored, which would be beneficial for applications such as Surface Enhancement Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). Nanoparticle-based lattices have been widely used for biosensor applications. However, one of the major limitations of this type of device is the low tolerance to high concentrations of biomolecules, which significantly affects their performance. According to the studies carried out for this manuscript, it was demonstrated that the implemented geometry allows for the observation of an LSPR mode, which is responsible for the control and synchronization of other perceived resonances. This mode remains almost invariant when subjected to structural variations or changes in the angle of incidence of the electric field. These characteristics eliminate the limitation mentioned above, allowing for sensitivities 10^3 times higher than those achieved in conventional systems based on LSPR used to detect P. brasiliensis antigen.","sentences":["The strong coupling of plasmonic resonance modes in conductive pyramidal nanoparticles leads to an increase in the density of free charges on the surface.","By ensuring plasmonic coupling in the pyramidal nanoparticle lattice, the achieved field intensity is potentiated.","At the same time, a strong coupling between resonant modes is guaranteed, which results in the formation of new hybrid modes.","In this manuscript, we demonstrated a tunable double anticrossing interaction that results from the interaction between two Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) modes and a Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) wave.","The tuning is done as a function of the variation of the angle of incidence of the input electric field.","From the double anticrossing, an increase in field intensity in a blue-shifted LSPR mode located in the red wavelength region is observed.","This demonstrates that at certain angles of incidence, the intensity field obtained is strongly favored, which would be beneficial for applications such as Surface Enhancement Raman Spectroscopy (SERS).","Nanoparticle-based lattices have been widely used for biosensor applications.","However, one of the major limitations of this type of device is the low tolerance to high concentrations of biomolecules, which significantly affects their performance.","According to the studies carried out for this manuscript, it was demonstrated that the implemented geometry allows for the observation of an LSPR mode, which is responsible for the control and synchronization of other perceived resonances.","This mode remains almost invariant when subjected to structural variations or changes in the angle of incidence of the electric field.","These characteristics eliminate the limitation mentioned above, allowing for sensitivities 10^3 times higher than those achieved in conventional systems based on LSPR used to detect P. brasiliensis antigen."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12428v1","category":"physics.optics"}

The number of tokens each agent has represents the difference between the amount of service provisions and service requests by the agent.

Here, we present a comprehensive study of the five high-significance (FAR < 1 per year) BNS and NSBH candidates in O4a. Our follow-up campaigns relied on both target-of-opportunity observations (ToO) and re-weighting of the nominal survey schedule to maximize coverage. We describe the toolkit we have been developing, Fritz, an instance of SkyPortal, instrumental in coordinating and managing our telescope scheduling, candidate vetting, and follow-up observations through a user-friendly interface. ZTF covered a total of 2841 deg$^2$ within the skymaps of the high-significance GW events, reaching a median depth of g~20.2 mag. We circulated 15 candidates, but found no viable KN counterpart to any of the GW events.
