This paper aims to examine the implications of employing standardized codecs within deep vision pipelines. We find that using JPEG and H.264 coding significantly deteriorates the accuracy across a broad range of vision tasks and models.

In a processor unit, an adder is an important building block since it is used in Floating Point Units (FPU) and Arithmetic Logic Units (ALU). Also, pipeline techniques are used extensively to improve the throughput of the processing unit. To implement a pipeline requires adding a register at each sub-stage that result in increasing the latency. Moreover, designing a low power pipeline adder with low latency has drawn a lot of attention. In a pipelined architecture that uses Dual Edge Triggered (DET) based registers can help in reducing the latency since they can capture input data at both clock edges. However, for high input activity, a DET flip-flop consumes more power than a Single-Edge Triggered (SET) flip-flop. Moreover, it is required to replace each Flip-Flop (FF) in the processor with Dual Edge Triggered (DET) Flip-Flop which will be a considerable area and power overhead. Therefore, it is desirable to have a switchable DET to SET depending on input activity or load condition to reduce the dynamic power consumption.

The high mass X-ray binary GX 301--2 exhibits a very wide, variable and complicated CRSF in the average spectra, which should be two absorption lines based on NuStar and Insight-HXMT observations. With the Insight-HXMT frequent observations, we performed the phase-resolved spectroscopy and confirmed two cyclotron absorption lines in the phase-resolved spectra, with their centroid energy ratio $\\sim 1.6-1.7$ in the super-critical luminosity case. A major hindrance in understanding those CRSFs is the very poorly constrained magnetic inclination angle, which is also a fundamental property of a NS and key to understanding the emission characteristics of a pulsar. Comparing the phase-resolved CRSF with simulated X-ray spectra, the magnetic inclination angle is found to be $\\gtrsim 70^{\\circ}$, i.e., nearly orthogonal between the NS's spin and magnetic axies. The implications of an orthogonal rotator and magnetic structure evolution in the accreting X-ray binary are also discussed.","sentences":["Cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) are the absorption features in the X-ray spectra of strongly magnetized accretion neutron stars (NSs), which are probably the most reliable probe to the surface magnetic fields of NSs.","The high mass X-ray binary GX 301--2 exhibits a very wide, variable and complicated CRSF in the average spectra, which should be two absorption lines based on NuStar and Insight-HXMT observations.","With the Insight-HXMT frequent observations, we performed the phase-resolved spectroscopy and confirmed two cyclotron absorption lines in the phase-resolved spectra, with their centroid energy ratio $\\sim 1.6-1.7$ in the super-critical luminosity case.","A major hindrance in understanding those CRSFs is the very poorly constrained magnetic inclination angle, which is also a fundamental property of a NS and key to understanding the emission characteristics of a pulsar.","Comparing the phase-resolved CRSF with simulated X-ray spectra, the magnetic inclination angle is found to be $\\gtrsim 70^{\\circ}$, i.e., nearly orthogonal between the NS's spin and magnetic axies.","The implications of an orthogonal rotator and magnetic structure evolution in the accreting X-ray binary are also discussed."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11829v1","category":"astro-ph.HE"}
