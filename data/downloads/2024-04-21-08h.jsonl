Although individual methods have been proposed for each of these tasks, they lack a common theoretical background integrating their solutions. Here, we introduce an information theoretical framework that unifies predictions of phase transformations, kinetic events, dataset optimality, and model-free UQ from atomistic simulations, thus bridging materials modeling, ML, and statistical mechanics. We first demonstrate that, for a proposed representation, the information entropy of a distribution of atom-centered environments is a surrogate value for thermodynamic entropy. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that information entropy differences from trajectories can be used to build phase diagrams, identify rare events, and recover classical theories of nucleation.

We studied the transmission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-127b during one transit in the K band with CRIRES+. Telluric and stellar signals were removed from the data using SYSREM and the planetary signal was investigated using the cross-correlation (CCF) technique. After detecting a spectral signal indicative of atmospheric inhomogeneities, we employed a Bayesian retrieval framework with a 2D modelling approach tailored to address this scenario. We detected strong signals of H$_2$O and CO, which exhibited not one but two distinct CCF peaks. The double peaked signal can be explained by a supersonic equatorial jet and muted signals at the poles, with the two peaks representing the signals from the planet's morning and evening terminators, respectively. We calculated an equatorial jet velocity of $7.7\\pm0.2$km/s from our retrieved overall equatorial velocity and the planet's tidally locked rotation, and derive distinct atmospheric properties for the two terminators as well as the polar region. The evening terminator is found to be hotter than the morning terminator by $175^{+116}_{-133}$K and the muted signals from the poles can be explained by significantly lower temperatures or a high cloud deck.

Traditional workflows to convert static clipart images into motion sequences are laborious and time-consuming, involving numerous intricate steps like rigging, key animation and in-betweening. Recent advancements in text-to-video generation hold great potential in resolving this problem. Nevertheless, direct application of text-to-video generation models often struggles to retain the visual identity of clipart images or generate cartoon-style motions, resulting in unsatisfactory animation outcomes. In this paper, we introduce AniClipart, a system that transforms static clipart images into high-quality motion sequences guided by text-to-video priors. To generate cartoon-style and smooth motion, we first define B\\'{e}zier curves over keypoints of the clipart image as a form of motion regularization. We then align the motion trajectories of the keypoints with the provided text prompt by optimizing the Video Score Distillation Sampling (VSDS) loss, which encodes adequate knowledge of natural motion within a pretrained text-to-video diffusion model.

However, multilingual human preference data are difficult to obtain at scale, making it challenging to extend this framework to diverse languages. In this work, we evaluate a simple approach for zero-shot cross-lingual alignment, where a reward model is trained on preference data in one source language and directly applied to other target languages.

Use of RAG for combined understanding of multimodal data such as text, images and videos is appealing but two critical limitations exist: one-time, upfront capture of all content in large multimodal data as text descriptions entails high processing times, and not all information in the rich multimodal data is typically in the text descriptions. Since the user queries are not known apriori, developing a system for multimodal to text conversion and interactive querying of multimodal data is challenging.   To address these limitations, we propose iRAG, which augments RAG with a novel incremental workflow to enable interactive querying of large corpus of multimodal data. Unlike traditional RAG, iRAG quickly indexes large repositories of multimodal data, and in the incremental workflow, it uses the index to opportunistically extract more details from select portions of the multimodal data to retrieve context relevant to an interactive user query. Such an incremental workflow avoids long multimodal to text conversion times, overcomes information loss issues by doing on-demand query-specific extraction of details in multimodal data, and ensures high quality of responses to interactive user queries that are often not known apriori. To the best of our knowledge, iRAG is the first system to augment RAG with an incremental workflow to support efficient interactive querying of large, real-world multimodal data. Experimental results on real-world long videos demonstrate 23x to 25x faster video to text ingestion, while ensuring that quality of responses to interactive user queries is comparable to responses from a traditional RAG where all video data is converted to text upfront before any querying.","sentences":["Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems combine the strengths of language generation and information retrieval to power many real-world applications like chatbots.","Use of RAG for combined understanding of multimodal data such as text, images and videos is appealing but two critical limitations exist: one-time, upfront capture of all content in large multimodal data as text descriptions entails high processing times, and not all information in the rich multimodal data is typically in the text descriptions.","Since the user queries are not known apriori, developing a system for multimodal to text conversion and interactive querying of multimodal data is challenging.

The primary focus of their research is to ensure safety, comfort, and efficiency. An autonomous vehicle has several modules responsible for one or more of the aforementioned items. Among these modules, the trajectory planner plays a pivotal role in the safety of the vehicle and the comfort of its passengers. The module is also responsible for respecting kinematic constraints and any applicable road constraints. In this paper, a novel online spatial-temporal graph trajectory planner is introduced to generate safe and comfortable trajectories. First, a spatial-temporal graph is constructed using the autonomous vehicle, its surrounding vehicles, and virtual nodes along the road with respect to the vehicle itself. Next, the graph is forwarded into a sequential network to obtain the desired states. To support the planner, a simple behavioral layer is also presented that determines kinematic constraints for the planner. Furthermore, a novel potential function is also proposed to train the network. Finally, the proposed planner is tested on three different complex driving tasks, and the performance is compared with two frequently used methods. The results show that the proposed planner generates safe and feasible trajectories while achieving similar or longer distances in the forward direction and comparable comfort ride.","sentences":["The autonomous driving industry is expected to grow by over 20 times in the coming decade and, thus, motivate researchers to delve into it.","The primary focus of their research is to ensure safety, comfort, and efficiency.","An autonomous vehicle has several modules responsible for one or more of the aforementioned items.","Among these modules, the trajectory planner plays a pivotal role in the safety of the vehicle and the comfort of its passengers.","The module is also responsible for respecting kinematic constraints and any applicable road constraints.","In this paper, a novel online spatial-temporal graph trajectory planner is introduced to generate safe and comfortable trajectories.","First, a spatial-temporal graph is constructed using the autonomous vehicle, its surrounding vehicles, and virtual nodes along the road with respect to the vehicle itself.","Next, the graph is forwarded into a sequential network to obtain the desired states.","To support the planner, a simple behavioral layer is also presented that determines kinematic constraints for the planner.","Furthermore, a novel potential function is also proposed to train the network.","Finally, the proposed planner is tested on three different complex driving tasks, and the performance is compared with two frequently used methods.","The results show that the proposed planner generates safe and feasible trajectories while achieving similar or longer distances in the forward direction and comparable comfort ride."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12256v1","category":"cs.RO"}

Often, this information describes the state of stationary resources, e.g. the availability of parking bays, charging stations or the amount of people waiting for a vehicle to pick them up near a given location. To exploit this kind of information, predicting future states of the monitored resources is often mandatory because a resource might change its state within the time until it is needed. To train an accurate predictive model, it is often not possible to obtain a continuous time series on the state of the resource. For example, the information might be collected from traveling agents visiting the resource with an irregular frequency. Thus, it is necessary to develop methods which work on sparse observations for training and prediction. In this paper, we propose time-inhomogeneous discrete Markov models to allow accurate prediction even when the frequency of observation is very rare. Our new model is able to blend recent observations with historic data and also provide useful probabilistic estimates for future states. Since resources availability in a city is typically time-dependent, our Markov model is time-inhomogeneous and cyclic within a predefined time interval.

To ensure such fine-tuned LLMs align with human preferences, techniques such as RLHF and DPO have emerged. At the same time, there is increasing interest in smaller parameter counts for models. In this work, using OpenLLaMA 3Bv2 as a base model, we describe the recipe used to fine-tune the OpenBezoar family of models. In this recipe: We first generate synthetic instruction fine-tuning data using an open and commercially non-restrictive instruction fine-tuned variant of the Falcon-40B model under three schemes based on: LaMini-LM, WizardLM/Evol-Instruct (with databricks-dolly-15k as a seed dataset) and Orca (with the Flan Collection as a seed dataset), then filter these generations using GPT-4 as a human proxy.

Benchmarking their performance is essential for selecting current models and guiding future model developments for this task. The lack of a standardized benchmark complicates comparisons. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to study how VFMs should be benchmarked for semantic segmentation. To do so, various VFMs are fine-tuned under various settings, and the impact of individual settings on the performance ranking and training time is assessed. Based on the results, the recommendation is to fine-tune the ViT-B variants of VFMs with a 16x16 patch size and a linear decoder, as these settings are representative of using a larger model, more advanced decoder and smaller patch size, while reducing training time by more than 13 times. Using multiple datasets for training and evaluation is also recommended, as the performance ranking across datasets and domain shifts varies. Linear probing, a common practice for some VFMs, is not recommended, as it is not representative of end-to-end fine-tuning.

Specifically, we propose an invertible neural network (INN)-based signal steganography approach, which embeds channel input signals of a private image into those of a host image before transmission. This ensures that the original private image can be reconstructed from the received signals at the legitimate receiver, while the eavesdropper can only decode the information of the host image. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach maintains comparable reconstruction quality of both host and private images at the legitimate receiver, compared to scenarios without any secure mechanisms.

Shock waves driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and corotating interaction regions (CIRs) occasionally act as potent particle accelerators, generating hazardous solar energetic particles (SEPs) that pose risks to satellite electronics and astronauts. Numerical simulation tools capable of modelling and predicting large SEP events are thus highly demanded. We introduce the new Icarus$+$PARADISE model as an advancement of the previous EUHFORIA$+$PARADISE model. Icarus, based on the MPI-AMRVAC framework, is a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic code that models solar wind configurations from 0.1 au onwards, encompassing transient structures like CMEs or CIRs. Differing from EUHFORIA's uniform-only grid, Icarus incorporates solution adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and grid stretching. The particle transport code PARADISE propagates energetic particles as test particles through these solar wind configurations by solving the focused transport equation in a stochastic manner. We validate our new model by reproducing EUHFORIA+PARADISE results. This is done by modelling the acceleration and transport of energetic particles in a synthetic solar wind configuration containing an embedded CIR. Subsequently, we illustrate how the simulation results vary with grid resolution by employing different levels of AMR. The resulting intensity profiles illustrate increased particle acceleration with higher levels of AMR in the shock region, better capturing the effects of the shock.","sentences":["With the rise of satellites and mankind's growing dependence on technology, there is an increasing awareness of space weather phenomena related to high-energy particles.","Shock waves driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and corotating interaction regions (CIRs) occasionally act as potent particle accelerators, generating hazardous solar energetic particles (SEPs) that pose risks to satellite electronics and astronauts.","Numerical simulation tools capable of modelling and predicting large SEP events are thus highly demanded.","We introduce the new Icarus$+$PARADISE model as an advancement of the previous EUHFORIA$+$PARADISE model.","Icarus, based on the MPI-AMRVAC framework, is a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic code that models solar wind configurations from 0.1 au onwards, encompassing transient structures like CMEs or CIRs.","Differing from EUHFORIA's uniform-only grid, Icarus incorporates solution adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and grid stretching.","The particle transport code PARADISE propagates energetic particles as test particles through these solar wind configurations by solving the focused transport equation in a stochastic manner.","We validate our new model by reproducing EUHFORIA+PARADISE results.","This is done by modelling the acceleration and transport of energetic particles in a synthetic solar wind configuration containing an embedded CIR.","Subsequently, we illustrate how the simulation results vary with grid resolution by employing different levels of AMR.","The resulting intensity profiles illustrate increased particle acceleration with higher levels of AMR in the shock region, better capturing the effects of the shock."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12164v1","category":"physics.space-ph"}

This work presents a couple of symmetry protection protocols for simulating the exact dynamics of SU(3) gauge theory in $1+1$ dimension.

First, I argue that aligning LMs can be seen as Bayesian inference: conditioning a prior (base, pretrained LM) on evidence about human preferences (Chapter 2). Conditioning on human preferences can be implemented in numerous ways. In Chapter 3, I investigate the relation between two approaches to finetuning pretrained LMs using feedback given by a scoring function: reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and distribution matching. I show that RLHF can be seen as a special case of distribution matching but distributional matching is strictly more general. In chapter 4, I show how to extend the distribution matching to conditional language models. Finally, in chapter 5 I explore a different root: conditioning an LM on human preferences already during pretraining. I show that involving human feedback from the very start tends to be more effective than using it only during supervised finetuning.

In this philosophically inspired work, we aim to create some separation between form and meaning, with a series of tests that leverage the idea that world understanding should be consistent across presentational modes - inspired by Fregean senses - of the same meaning. Specifically, we focus on consistency across languages as well as paraphrases. Taking GPT-3.5 as our object of study, we evaluate multisense consistency across five different languages and various tasks. We start the evaluation in a controlled setting, asking the model for simple facts, and then proceed with an evaluation on four popular NLU benchmarks.

Recent research has unveiled the potential of LLMs to role-play assigned personas, mimicking their knowledge and linguistic habits. However, imitative decision-making requires a more nuanced understanding of personas. In this paper, we benchmark the ability of LLMs in persona-driven decision-making. Specifically, we investigate whether LLMs can predict characters' decisions provided with the preceding stories in high-quality novels. Leveraging character analyses written by literary experts, we construct a dataset LIFECHOICE comprising 1,401 character decision points from 395 books. Then, we conduct comprehensive experiments on LIFECHOICE, with various LLMs and methods for LLM role-playing.

Although, typically care is taken to use values as close as possible to realistic values within the computational constraints, these artificial values could potentially introduce unphysical effects. These unphysical effects could be significant at sub-ion scales, where kinetic effects are the most important. In this paper, we use the ten-moment fluid model in the Gkeyll framework to perform controlled numerical experiments, systematically varying the ion-electron mass ratio from a small value down to the realistic proton-electron mass ratio. We show that the unphysical mass ratio has a significant effect on the kinetic range dynamics as well as the heating of both the plasma species. The dissipative process for both ions and electrons become more compressive in nature, although the ions remain nearly incompressible in all cases. The electrons move from being dominated by incompressive viscous like heating/dissipation, to very compressive heating/dissipation dominated by compressions/rarefactions. While the heating change is significant for the electrons, a mass ratio of $m_i/m_e \\sim 250$ captures the asymptotic behaviour of electron heating.","sentences":["Understanding plasma turbulence requires a synthesis of experiments, observations, theory, and simulations.","In the case of kinetic plasmas such as the solar wind, the lack of collisions renders the fluid closures such as viscosity meaningless and one needs to resort to higher order fluid models or kinetic models.","Typically, the computational expense in such models is managed by simulating artificial values of certain parameters such as the ratio of the Alfv\\'en speed to the speed of light ($v_A/c$) or the relative mass ratio of ions and electrons ($m_i/m_e$).","Although, typically care is taken to use values as close as possible to realistic values within the computational constraints, these artificial values could potentially introduce unphysical effects.","These unphysical effects could be significant at sub-ion scales, where kinetic effects are the most important.","In this paper, we use the ten-moment fluid model in the Gkeyll framework to perform controlled numerical experiments, systematically varying the ion-electron mass ratio from a small value down to the realistic proton-electron mass ratio.","We show that the unphysical mass ratio has a significant effect on the kinetic range dynamics as well as the heating of both the plasma species.","The dissipative process for both ions and electrons become more compressive in nature, although the ions remain nearly incompressible in all cases.","The electrons move from being dominated by incompressive viscous like heating/dissipation, to very compressive heating/dissipation dominated by compressions/rarefactions.","While the heating change is significant for the electrons, a mass ratio of $m_i/m_e \\sim 250$ captures the asymptotic behaviour of electron heating."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12105v1","category":"physics.plasm-ph"}

An important unanswered question is how ordinary voters perceive such a mitigation: whether they could understand and use fake credentials, and whether the coercion risks justify the costs of mitigation. We present the first systematic study of these questions, involving 150 diverse individuals in Boston, Massachusetts. All participants \"registered\" and \"voted\" in a mock election: 120 were exposed to coercion resistance via fake credentials, the rest forming a control group. Of the 120 participants exposed to fake credentials, 96% understood their use. 53% reported that they would create fake credentials in a real-world voting scenario, given the opportunity. 10% mistakenly voted with a fake credential, however. 22% reported either personal experience with or direct knowledge of coercion or vote-buying incidents. These latter participants rated the coercion-resistant system essentially as trustworthy as in-person voting via hand-marked paper ballots. Of the 150 total participants to use the system, 87% successfully created their credentials without assistance; 83% both successfully created and properly used their credentials. Participants give a System Usability Scale score of 70.4, which is slightly above the industry's average score of 68.

The expected gravitational signals are short-duration pulses that would repeat over a much longer time scale in case of multiple passages at periastron. These sources represent a unique opportunity of exploring astrophysical formation channels as well as a different way of testing GR. In the case of binary systems containing neutron stars, the observation of these sources could help to constrain the EOS, thanks to the signature left in the GW signal by the f-modes excitation that can occur during the encounter. The detection and PE of these signals is challenging given the short duration of expected signals and the sensitivities of current ground-based GW interferometers. We present a novel approach that exploits Probabilistic ML. We have used Conditional Normalizing Flows to model complex probability distributions and therefore infer posterior distributions for the source parameters. Fast detection and PE is very important as it could trigger electromagnetic follow-up campaigns and offer the possibility to study these events in a multimessenger context. To develop and test the algorithm, we have focused on the simulations of single bursts emission obtained using the Effective Fly-by formalism and embedded in the noise of aLIGO and Virgo during O3. Our proposed model outperforms standard Bayesian methods in accuracy and is 5 orders of magnitude faster, being able to produce 5x10^4 posterior samples in just 0.5s.

Existing datasets in the domain lack syntactic and lexical diversity, resulting in paraphrases that closely resemble the source sentences. Moreover, these datasets often contain hate speech and noise, and may unintentionally include non-English language sentences. This research introduces ParaFusion, a large-scale, high-quality English paraphrase dataset developed using Large Language Models (LLM) to address these challenges. ParaFusion augments existing datasets with high-quality data, significantly enhancing both lexical and syntactic diversity while maintaining close semantic similarity. It also mitigates the presence of hate speech and reduces noise, ensuring a cleaner and more focused English dataset.

An Analysis from the Spectral Perspective","abstract":"Recommendation Systems (RS) are often plagued by popularity bias. Specifically,when recommendation models are trained on long-tailed datasets, they not only inherit this bias but often exacerbate it. This effect undermines both the precision and fairness of RS and catalyzes the so-called Matthew Effect. Despite the widely recognition of this issue, the fundamental causes remain largely elusive. In our research, we delve deeply into popularity bias amplification. Our comprehensive theoretical and empirical investigations lead to two core insights: 1) Item popularity is memorized in the principal singular vector of the score matrix predicted by the recommendation model; 2) The dimension collapse phenomenon amplifies the impact of principal singular vector on model predictions, intensifying the popularity bias. Based on these insights, we propose a novel method to mitigate this bias by imposing penalties on the magnitude of the principal singular value. Considering the heavy computational burden in directly evaluating the gradient of the principal singular value, we develop an efficient algorithm that harnesses the inherent properties of the singular vector. Extensive experiments across seven real-world datasets and three testing scenarios have been conducted to validate the superiority of our method.","sentences":["Recommendation Systems (RS) are often plagued by popularity bias.","Specifically,when recommendation models are trained on long-tailed datasets, they not only inherit this bias but often exacerbate it.","This effect undermines both the precision and fairness of RS and catalyzes the so-called Matthew Effect.","Despite the widely recognition of this issue, the fundamental causes remain largely elusive.","In our research, we delve deeply into popularity bias amplification.","Our comprehensive theoretical and empirical investigations lead to two core insights: 1) Item popularity is memorized in the principal singular vector of the score matrix predicted by the recommendation model; 2) The dimension collapse phenomenon amplifies the impact of principal singular vector on model predictions, intensifying the popularity bias.","Based on these insights, we propose a novel method to mitigate this bias by imposing penalties on the magnitude of the principal singular value.","Considering the heavy computational burden in directly evaluating the gradient of the principal singular value, we develop an efficient algorithm that harnesses the inherent properties of the singular vector.","Extensive experiments across seven real-world datasets and three testing scenarios have been conducted to validate the superiority of our method."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12008v1","category":"cs.IR"}

The associated hard X-ray (HXR) and microwave radiation is generated by energetic electrons, which carry a substantial part of the energy released during a flare. The flare is generally understood as a manifestation of magnetic reconnection in the corona. The so-called standard CSHKP model is one of the most widely accepted models for eruptive flares. The solar flare on September 10, 2017 offers a unique opportunity to study this model. The observations from the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) show that 1.6x10^4 electrons with energies >300 keV were generated in the flare region. There are signatures in solar radio and extreme ultraviolet observations as well as numerical simulations that a termination shock (TS) appears in the magnetic reconnection outflow region. Electrons accelerated at the TS can be considered to generate the loop-top HXR sources. In contrast to previous studies, we investigate whether the heating of the plasma at the TS provides enough relativistic electrons needed for the HXR and microwave emission observed during the X8.2 solar flare on September 10, 2017. We studied the heating of the plasma at the TS by evaluating the jump in the temperature across the shock by means of the Rankine-Hugoniot relationships under coronal circumstances measured during that event. The part of relativistic electrons was calculated in the heated downstream region. In the magnetic reconnection outflow region, the plasma is strongly heated at the TS. Thus, there are enough energetic electrons in the tail of the electron distribution function needed for the microwave and HXR emission observed during that event. The generation of relativistic electrons at the TS is a possible mechanism to explain the enhanced microwave and HXR radiation emitted during flares.","sentences":["Solar flares are accompanied by an enhanced emission of electromagnetic waves from the radio up to the gamma-ray range.","The associated hard X-ray (HXR) and microwave radiation is generated by energetic electrons, which carry a substantial part of the energy released during a flare.","The flare is generally understood as a manifestation of magnetic reconnection in the corona.","The so-called standard CSHKP model is one of the most widely accepted models for eruptive flares.","The solar flare on September 10, 2017 offers a unique opportunity to study this model.","The observations from the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) show that 1.6x10^4 electrons with energies >300 keV were generated in the flare region.","There are signatures in solar radio and extreme ultraviolet observations as well as numerical simulations that a termination shock (TS) appears in the magnetic reconnection outflow region.","Electrons accelerated at the TS can be considered to generate the loop-top HXR sources.","In contrast to previous studies, we investigate whether the heating of the plasma at the TS provides enough relativistic electrons needed for the HXR and microwave emission observed during the X8.2 solar flare on September 10, 2017.","We studied the heating of the plasma at the TS by evaluating the jump in the temperature across the shock by means of the Rankine-Hugoniot relationships under coronal circumstances measured during that event.","The part of relativistic electrons was calculated in the heated downstream region.","In the magnetic reconnection outflow region, the plasma is strongly heated at the TS.","Thus, there are enough energetic electrons in the tail of the electron distribution function needed for the microwave and HXR emission observed during that event.","The generation of relativistic electrons at the TS is a possible mechanism to explain the enhanced microwave and HXR radiation emitted during flares."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12005v1","category":"astro-ph.SR"}

However, their robustness under 3D viewpoint variations is still limited, which can hinder the development for real-world applications. This paper successfully addresses this concern while keeping VLPs' original performance by breaking through two primary obstacles: 1) the scarcity of training data and 2) the suboptimal fine-tuning paradigms. To combat data scarcity, we build the Multi-View Caption (MVCap) dataset -- a comprehensive collection of over four million multi-view image-text pairs across more than 100K objects, providing more potential for VLP models to develop generalizable viewpoint-invariant representations. To address the limitations of existing paradigms in performance trade-offs and training efficiency, we design a novel fine-tuning framework named Omniview-Tuning (OVT).

Recent research has shown that such NR interactions can have tremendous effects on the overall collective behaviour and pattern formation, but can also influence aggregation processes on the particle scale. Here we focus on the impact of non-reciprocity on the self-assembly of an (originally passive) colloidal system with anisotropic interactions whose character is tunable by external fields. In the absence of non-reciprocity, that is, under equilibrium conditions, the colloids form aggregates with extremely long life times [Kogler et al., Soft Matter 11, 7356 (2015)], indicating kinetic trapping. Here we study, based on Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations in 2D, a NR version of this model consisting of two species with reciprocal isotropic, but NR anisotropic interactions. We find that NR induces an effective propulsion of particle pairs and small aggregates forming at initial stages of self-assembly, an indication of the NR-induced non-equilibrium. The shape and stability of these initial clusters strongly depends on the degree of anisotropy. At longer times we find, for weak NR interactions, large (even system-spanning) clusters where single particles can escape and enter at the boundaries, in stark contrast to the small rigid aggregates appearing at the same time in the passive case. In this sense, weak NR shortcuts the aggregation. Increasing the degree of NR (and thus, propulsion), we even observe large-scale phase separation if the interactions are weakly anisotropic. In contrast, system with strong NR and anisotropy remain essentially disordered. Overall, NR interactions are shown to destabilize the rigid aggregates interrupting self-assembly in the passive case, helping the system to overcome kinetic barriers.","sentences":["Non-reciprocal (NR) effective interactions violating Newton's third law occur in many biological systems, but can also be engineered in synthetic, colloidal systems.","Recent research has shown that such NR interactions can have tremendous effects on the overall collective behaviour and pattern formation, but can also influence aggregation processes on the particle scale.","Here we focus on the impact of non-reciprocity on the self-assembly of an (originally passive) colloidal system with anisotropic interactions whose character is tunable by external fields.","In the absence of non-reciprocity, that is, under equilibrium conditions, the colloids form aggregates with extremely long life times","[Kogler et al., Soft Matter 11, 7356 (2015)], indicating kinetic trapping.","Here we study, based on Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations in 2D, a NR version of this model consisting of two species with reciprocal isotropic, but NR anisotropic interactions.","We find that NR induces an effective propulsion of particle pairs and small aggregates forming at initial stages of self-assembly, an indication of the NR-induced non-equilibrium.","The shape and stability of these initial clusters strongly depends on the degree of anisotropy.","At longer times we find, for weak NR interactions, large (even system-spanning) clusters where single particles can escape and enter at the boundaries, in stark contrast to the small rigid aggregates appearing at the same time in the passive case.","In this sense, weak NR shortcuts the aggregation.","Increasing the degree of NR (and thus, propulsion), we even observe large-scale phase separation if the interactions are weakly anisotropic.","In contrast, system with strong NR and anisotropy remain essentially disordered.","Overall, NR interactions are shown to destabilize the rigid aggregates interrupting self-assembly in the passive case, helping the system to overcome kinetic barriers."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12108v1","category":"cond-mat.soft"}

The recovery took place while clearing the remnants of a snow avalanche, 2 km northwest of Ischgl in Austria. Subsequent to its retrieval, the specimen remained in the finder's private residence without undergoing any scientific examination or identification until 2008, when it was brought to the University of Innsbruck. The sample was classified as a well-preserved LL6 chondrite, with a W0 weathering grade, implying a relatively short time between the meteorite fall and its retrieval. To investigate the potential connection between the Ischgl meteorite and a recorded fireball event, we have reviewed all documented fireballs ever photographed by German fireball camera stations. This examination led us to identify the fireball EN241170 observed in Germany by ten different European Network stations on the night of November 23/24, 1970, as the most likely candidate. We employed state-of-the-art techniques to reconstruct the fireball's trajectory, and to reproduce both its luminous and dark flight phases in detail. We find that the determined strewn field and the generated heat map closely align with the recovery location of the Ischgl meteorite. Furthermore, the measured radionuclide data reported here indicate that the pre-atmospheric size of the Ischgl meteoroid is consistent with the mass estimate inferred from our deceleration analysis along the trajectory. Our findings strongly support the conclusion that the Ischgl meteorite originated from the EN241170 fireball, effectively establishing it as a confirmed meteorite fall.

The reason for the extended main sequences is now known, with the most probable cause being the fast rotation of stars. However, a significant fraction of slowly rotating stars form a younger stellar population than their fast-rotating counterparts, leading to speculation that they have undergone thorough rotational mixing processes internally. One speculation is that a considerable number of slowly rotating stars reside in close binary systems, where tidal forces from companion stars are the cause of their rotational deceleration. In this work, we report a relatively old open star cluster in the Milky Way, NGC 2423 ($\\sim$1 Gyrs old), which exhibits an apparent eMSTO. As anticipated, many characteristics of NGC 2423 indicate that its eMSTO is driven by stellar rotations. Our calculations indicate that if slowly rotating stars commonly have a close companion star, they should exhibit significant differences in radial velocities observationally, and binary systems that can be tidally locked within the age of NGC 2423 should have a mass ratio close to 1. However, none of these predictions align with our observations. Interestingly, among the only two equal-mass binary systems in the observed region for which spectroscopic data could be obtained, we discovered that one of them is a tidally locked binary system.

We show that this configuration arises naturally as a result of planet-planet scattering when the planets possess satellite systems. Planet-planet scattering explains the orbital eccentricities of the discs' host bodies, while the close encounters during scattering lead to the exchange of satellites between planets and/or their destabilisation. This leads to collisions between satellites and their tidal disruption close to the planet. Both of these events lead to large quantities of debris being produced, which in time will settle into a disc such as those observed. The mass of debris required is comparable to a Ceres-sized satellite. Through N-body simulations of planets with clones of the Galilean satellite system undergoing scattering, we show that 90 percent of planets undergoing scattering will possess debris from satellite destruction. Extrapolating to smaller numbers of satellites suggests that tens of percent of such planets should still possess circumplanetary debris discs. The debris trails arising from these events are often tilted at tens of degrees to the planetary orbit, consistent with the inclinations of the observed discs. Disruption of satellite systems during scattering thus simultaneously explains the existence of debris, the tilt of the discs, and the eccentricity of the planets they orbit.","sentences":["Several stars show deep transits consistent with discs of roughly 1 Solar radius seen at moderate inclinations, likely surrounding planets on eccentric orbits.","We show that this configuration arises naturally as a result of planet-planet scattering when the planets possess satellite systems.","Planet-planet scattering explains the orbital eccentricities of the discs' host bodies, while the close encounters during scattering lead to the exchange of satellites between planets and/or their destabilisation.","This leads to collisions between satellites and their tidal disruption close to the planet.","Both of these events lead to large quantities of debris being produced, which in time will settle into a disc such as those observed.","The mass of debris required is comparable to a Ceres-sized satellite.","Through N-body simulations of planets with clones of the Galilean satellite system undergoing scattering, we show that 90 percent of planets undergoing scattering will possess debris from satellite destruction.","Extrapolating to smaller numbers of satellites suggests that tens of percent of such planets should still possess circumplanetary debris discs.","The debris trails arising from these events are often tilted at tens of degrees to the planetary orbit, consistent with the inclinations of the observed discs.","Disruption of satellite systems during scattering thus simultaneously explains the existence of debris, the tilt of the discs, and the eccentricity of the planets they orbit."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12239v1","category":"astro-ph.EP"}

This study explores the intersection of reinforcement learning and data privacy, specifically addressing the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem with the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. We introduce zkUCB, an innovative algorithm that employs the Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) to enhance UCB. zkUCB is carefully designed to safeguard the confidentiality of training data and algorithmic parameters, ensuring transparent UCB decision-making.

A neural State-Space Model (NSSM) is used to approximate the nonlinear system, where a deep encoder network learns the nonlinearity from data, and a state-space component captures the temporal relationship. This transforms the nonlinear system into a linear system in a latent space, enabling the application of model predictive control (MPC) to determine effective control actions. Our objective is to design the optimal controller using limited data from the \\textit{target system} (the system of interest). To this end, we employ an implicit model-agnostic meta-learning (iMAML) framework that leverages information from \\textit{source systems} (systems that share similarities with the target system) to expedite training in the target system and enhance its control performance. The framework consists of two phases: the (offine) meta-training phase learns a aggregated NSSM using data from source systems, and the (online) meta-inference phase quickly adapts this aggregated model to the target system using only a few data points and few online training iterations, based on local loss function gradients. The iMAML algorithm exploits the implicit function theorem to exactly compute the gradient during training, without relying on the entire optimization path. By focusing solely on the optimal solution, rather than the path, we can meta-train with less storage complexity and fewer approximations than other contemporary meta-learning algorithms.

Existing studies mainly focus on classifying texts into binary categories, often overlooking the continuous spectrum of offensiveness and hatefulness inherent in the text. In this research, we present an extensive benchmark dataset for Amharic, comprising 8,258 tweets annotated for three distinct tasks: category classification, identification of hate targets, and rating offensiveness and hatefulness intensities. Our study highlights that a considerable majority of tweets belong to the less offensive and less hate intensity levels, underscoring the need for early interventions by stakeholders. The prevalence of ethnic and political hatred targets, with significant overlaps in our dataset, emphasizes the complex relationships within Ethiopia's sociopolitical landscape. We build classification and regression models and investigate the efficacy of models in handling these tasks.

Hydrogen production in a grid-connected hybrid renewable energy plant necessitates smart planning to meet long-term hydrogen trading agreements while minimising costs and emissions. Previous research analysed economic and environmental impact of hydrogen production based on full foresight of renewable energy availabilty, electricity price, and CO2 intensity in the electricity grid. However, the full foresight assumption is impractical in day-to-day operation, often leading to underestimations of both the cost and CO2 emissions associated with hydrogen production. Therefore, this research introduces a novel long-term planner that uses historical data and short-term forecasts to plan hydrogen production in the day-to-day operation of a grid-connected hybrid renewable energy plant. The long-term planner co-minimises cost and CO2 emissions to determine the hydrogen production for the next day taking into account the remaining hydrogen production and the time remaining until the end of the delivery period, which can be a week, a month, or a year. Extended delivery periods provide operation flexibility, enabling cost and CO2 emissions reductions. Significant reductions in CO2 emissions can be achieved with relatively small increases in the levelised cost. Under day-to-day operation, the levelised cost of hydrogen is marginally higher than that of the full foresight; the CO2 emissions can be up to 60% higher. Despite a significant portion of the produced hydrogen not meeting the criteria for green hydrogen designation under current rules, CO2 emissions are lower than those from existing alternative hydrogen production methods. These results underscore the importance of balancing cost considerations with environmental impacts in operational decision-making.","sentences":["Green hydrogen is essential for producing renewable fuels that are needed in sectors that are hard to electrify directly.","Hydrogen production in a grid-connected hybrid renewable energy plant necessitates smart planning to meet long-term hydrogen trading agreements while minimising costs and emissions.","Previous research analysed economic and environmental impact of hydrogen production based on full foresight of renewable energy availabilty, electricity price, and CO2 intensity in the electricity grid.","However, the full foresight assumption is impractical in day-to-day operation, often leading to underestimations of both the cost and CO2 emissions associated with hydrogen production.","Therefore, this research introduces a novel long-term planner that uses historical data and short-term forecasts to plan hydrogen production in the day-to-day operation of a grid-connected hybrid renewable energy plant.","The long-term planner co-minimises cost and CO2 emissions to determine the hydrogen production for the next day taking into account the remaining hydrogen production and the time remaining until the end of the delivery period, which can be a week, a month, or a year.","Extended delivery periods provide operation flexibility, enabling cost and CO2 emissions reductions.","Significant reductions in CO2 emissions can be achieved with relatively small increases in the levelised cost.","Under day-to-day operation, the levelised cost of hydrogen is marginally higher than that of the full foresight; the CO2 emissions can be up to 60% higher.","Despite a significant portion of the produced hydrogen not meeting the criteria for green hydrogen designation under current rules, CO2 emissions are lower than those from existing alternative hydrogen production methods.","These results underscore the importance of balancing cost considerations with environmental impacts in operational decision-making."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11995v1","category":"eess.SY"}

Integrating both positive and negative feedback to form a signed graph can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of user preferences. However, the existing efforts to incorporate both types of feedback are sparse and face two main limitations: 1) They process positive and negative feedback separately, which fails to holistically leverage the collaborative information within the signed graph; 2) They rely on MLPs or GNNs for information extraction from negative feedback, which may not be effective.   To overcome these limitations, we introduce SIGformer, a new method that employs the transformer architecture to sign-aware graph-based recommendation. SIGformer incorporates two innovative positional encodings that capture the spectral properties and path patterns of the signed graph, enabling the full exploitation of the entire graph.

A prevailing way to solve WILSS is the generation of seed areas for each new class, serving as a form of pixel-level supervision. However, a scenario usually arises where a pixel is concurrently predicted as an old class by the pre-trained segmentation model and a new class by the seed areas. Such a scenario becomes particularly problematic in WILSS, as the lack of pixel-level annotations on new classes makes it intractable to ascertain whether the pixel pertains to the new class or not. To surmount this issue, we propose an innovative, tendency-driven relationship of mutual exclusivity, meticulously tailored to govern the behavior of the seed areas and the predictions generated by the pre-trained segmentation model. This relationship stipulates that predictions for the new and old classes must not conflict whilst prioritizing the preservation of predictions for the old classes, which not only addresses the conflicting prediction issue but also effectively mitigates the inherent challenge of incremental learning - catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, under the auspices of this tendency-driven mutual exclusivity relationship, we generate pseudo masks for the new classes, allowing for concurrent execution with model parameter updating via the resolution of a bi-level optimization problem.

This novel approach considers the backreaction from these energetic particles by incorporating the non-thermal fluid pressure into Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The pressure of the non-thermal fluid is evaluated from the energetic particle distribution evolved through Parker's transport equation, which is solved using stochastic differential equations. We implement this method in the HOW-MHD code (Seo \\& Ryu 2023), which achieves 5th-order accuracy. We find that without spatial diffusion, the method accurately reproduces the Riemann solution in the hydrodynamic shock tube test when including the non-thermal pressure. Solving Parker's transport equation allows the determination of pressure terms for both relativistic and non-relativistic non-thermal fluids with adiabatic indices $\\gamma_{\\rm{NT}}=4/3$ and $\\gamma_{\\rm{NT}}=5/3$, respectively. The method also successfully replicates the Magnetohydrodynamic shock tube test with non-thermal pressure, successfully resolving the discontinuities within a few cells.

As in many tasks sufficient pixel-level labels are very difficult to obtain, we propose a method which combines a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with unsupervised deep learning techniques. In the standard GMM the pixel values with each sub-region are modelled by a Gaussian distribution. In order to identify the different regions, the parameter vector that minimizes the negative log-likelihood (NLL) function regarding the GMM has to be approximated. For this task, usually iterative optimization methods such as the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm are used. In this paper, we propose to estimate these parameters directly from the image using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We thus change the iterative procedure in the EM algorithm replacing the expectation-step by a gradient-step with regard to the networks parameters. This means that the network is trained to minimize the NLL function of the GMM which comes with at least two advantages. As once trained, the network is able to predict label probabilities very quickly compared with time consuming iterative optimization methods. Secondly, due to the deep image prior our method is able to partially overcome one of the main disadvantages of GMM, which is not taking into account correlation between neighboring pixels, as it assumes independence between them. We demonstrate the advantages of our method in various experiments on the example of myocardial infarct segmentation on multi-sequence MRI images.","sentences":["The recent emergence of deep learning has led to a great deal of work on designing supervised deep semantic segmentation algorithms.","As in many tasks sufficient pixel-level labels are very difficult to obtain, we propose a method which combines a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with unsupervised deep learning techniques.","In the standard GMM the pixel values with each sub-region are modelled by a Gaussian distribution.","In order to identify the different regions, the parameter vector that minimizes the negative log-likelihood (NLL) function regarding the GMM has to be approximated.","For this task, usually iterative optimization methods such as the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm are used.","In this paper, we propose to estimate these parameters directly from the image using a convolutional neural network (CNN).","We thus change the iterative procedure in the EM algorithm replacing the expectation-step by a gradient-step with regard to the networks parameters.","This means that the network is trained to minimize the NLL function of the GMM which comes with at least two advantages.","As once trained, the network is able to predict label probabilities very quickly compared with time consuming iterative optimization methods.","Secondly, due to the deep image prior our method is able to partially overcome one of the main disadvantages of GMM, which is not taking into account correlation between neighboring pixels, as it assumes independence between them.","We demonstrate the advantages of our method in various experiments on the example of myocardial infarct segmentation on multi-sequence MRI images."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12252v1","category":"cs.CV"}

These serve as invaluable probes for unraveling the intricate structure and evolution of quasars, shedding light on the profound influence exerted by supermassive black holes on galaxy formation. The proliferation of large-scale spectroscopic surveys such as LAMOST, SDSS, and DESI has exponentially expanded the repository of quasar spectra at our disposal. In this study, we present an innovative approach to streamline the identification of BALQSOs, leveraging the power of dimensionality reduction and machine learning algorithms. Our dataset is curated from the SDSS DR16, amalgamating quasar spectra with classification labels sourced from the DR16Q quasar catalog. We employ a diverse array of dimensionality reduction techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), and Isometric Mapping (ISOMAP), to distill the essence of the original spectral data. The resultant low-dimensional representations serve as inputs for a suite of machine learning classifiers, including XGBoost and Random Forest models.

However, the typical low quality and high noise levels in such footage can severely impact the accuracy of pose estimation algorithms, which are foundational for reliable gait analysis. Existing literature suggests a direct correlation between the efficacy of pose estimation and the subsequent gait analysis results. A common mitigation strategy involves fine-tuning pose estimation models on noisy data to improve robustness. However, this approach may degrade the downstream model's performance on the original high-quality data, leading to a trade-off that is undesirable in practice. We propose a processing pipeline that incorporates a task-targeted artifact correction model specifically designed to pre-process and enhance surveillance footage before pose estimation. Our artifact correction model is optimized to work alongside a state-of-the-art pose estimation network, HRNet, without requiring repeated fine-tuning of the pose estimation model. Furthermore, we propose a simple and robust method for obtaining low quality videos that are annotated with poses in an automatic manner with the purpose of training the artifact correction model. We systematically evaluate the performance of our artifact correction model against a range of noisy surveillance data and demonstrate that our approach not only achieves improved pose estimation on low-quality surveillance footage, but also preserves the integrity of the pose estimation on high resolution footage. Our experiments show a clear enhancement in gait analysis performance, supporting the viability of the proposed method as a superior alternative to direct fine-tuning strategies.

While the context limit of LLMs has been pushed beyond 1 million tokens, embedding models are still confined to a narrow context window not exceeding 8k tokens, refrained from application scenarios requiring long inputs such as legal contracts. This paper explores context window extension of existing embedding models, pushing the limit to 32k without requiring additional training. First, we examine the performance of current embedding models for long context retrieval on our newly constructed LongEmbed benchmark. LongEmbed comprises two synthetic tasks and four carefully chosen real-world tasks, featuring documents of varying length and dispersed target information. Benchmarking results underscore huge room for improvement in these models. Based on this, comprehensive experiments show that training-free context window extension strategies like position interpolation can effectively extend the context window of existing embedding models by several folds, regardless of their original context being 512 or beyond 4k. Furthermore, for models employing absolute position encoding (APE), we show the possibility of further fine-tuning to harvest notable performance gains while strictly preserving original behavior for short inputs. For models using rotary position embedding (RoPE), significant enhancements are observed when employing RoPE-specific methods, such as NTK and SelfExtend, indicating RoPE's superiority over APE for context window extension. To facilitate future research, we release E5-Base-4k and E5-RoPE-Base, along with the LongEmbed benchmark.","sentences":["Embedding models play a pivot role in modern NLP applications such as IR and RAG.","While the context limit of LLMs has been pushed beyond 1 million tokens, embedding models are still confined to a narrow context window not exceeding 8k tokens, refrained from application scenarios requiring long inputs such as legal contracts.","This paper explores context window extension of existing embedding models, pushing the limit to 32k without requiring additional training.","First, we examine the performance of current embedding models for long context retrieval on our newly constructed LongEmbed benchmark.","LongEmbed comprises two synthetic tasks and four carefully chosen real-world tasks, featuring documents of varying length and dispersed target information.","Benchmarking results underscore huge room for improvement in these models.","Based on this, comprehensive experiments show that training-free context window extension strategies like position interpolation can effectively extend the context window of existing embedding models by several folds, regardless of their original context being 512 or beyond 4k.","Furthermore, for models employing absolute position encoding (APE), we show the possibility of further fine-tuning to harvest notable performance gains while strictly preserving original behavior for short inputs.","For models using rotary position embedding (RoPE), significant enhancements are observed when employing RoPE-specific methods, such as NTK and SelfExtend, indicating RoPE's superiority over APE for context window extension.","To facilitate future research, we release E5-Base-4k and E5-RoPE-Base, along with the LongEmbed benchmark."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12096v1","category":"cs.CL"}

Building on top of this representation, DG-Mesh recovers high-quality meshes from the Gaussian points and can track the mesh vertices over time, which enables applications such as texture editing on dynamic objects. We introduce the Gaussian-Mesh Anchoring, which encourages evenly distributed Gaussians, resulting better mesh reconstruction through mesh-guided densification and pruning on the deformed Gaussians. By applying cycle-consistent deformation between the canonical and the deformed space, we can project the anchored Gaussian back to the canonical space and optimize Gaussians across all time frames.
