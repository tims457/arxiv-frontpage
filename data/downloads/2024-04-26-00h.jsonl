Traditional detection methods need to trade off OOD detection and in-distribution (ID) classification performance since they share the same representation learning model. In this work, we propose to detect OOD molecules by adopting an auxiliary diffusion model-based framework, which compares similarities between input molecules and reconstructed graphs. Due to the generative bias towards reconstructing ID training samples, the similarity scores of OOD molecules will be much lower to facilitate detection. Although it is conceptually simple, extending this vanilla framework to practical detection applications is still limited by two significant challenges. First, the popular similarity metrics based on Euclidian distance fail to consider the complex graph structure. Second, the generative model involving iterative denoising steps is time-consuming especially when it runs on the enormous pool of drugs. To address these challenges, our research pioneers an approach of Prototypical Graph Reconstruction for Molecular OOD Detection, dubbed as PGR-MOOD and hinges on three innovations: i) An effective metric to comprehensively quantify the matching degree of input and reconstructed molecules; ii) A creative graph generator to construct prototypical graphs that are in line with ID but away from OOD; iii) An efficient and scalable OOD detector to compare the similarity between test samples and pre-constructed prototypical graphs and omit the generative process on every new molecule.

Our analysis shows that the myopic routing policy leads to severe under-exploration of stochastic paths. This results in a price of anarchy (PoA) greater than $2$, as compared to the socially optimal policy in minimizing the long-term social cost. Besides, the myopic policy fails to ensure the correct learning convergence about users' traffic hazard beliefs.

There is strong evidence that these models can perform remarkably well in various natural language processing tasks. However, how to leverage them to approach domain-specific use cases and drive value remains an open question. In this work, we focus on a specific use case, pharmaceutical manufacturing investigations, and propose that leveraging historical records of manufacturing incidents and deviations in an organization can be beneficial for addressing and closing new cases, or de-risking new manufacturing campaigns. Using a small but diverse dataset of real manufacturing deviations selected from different product lines, we evaluate and quantify the power of three general purpose LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude-2) in performing tasks related to the above goal. In particular, (1) the ability of LLMs in automating the process of extracting specific information such as root cause of a case from unstructured data, as well as (2) the possibility of identifying similar or related deviations by performing semantic search on the database of historical records are examined. While our results point to the high accuracy of GPT-4 and Claude-2 in the information extraction task, we discuss cases of complex interplay between the apparent reasoning and hallucination behavior of LLMs as a risk factor. Furthermore, we show that semantic search on vector embedding of deviation descriptions can be used to identify similar records, such as those with a similar type of defect, with a high level of accuracy.

This paper aims to address this question. Our systematic investigation across a wide spectrum of models reveals that a special type of attention heads are largely responsible for retrieving information, which we dub retrieval heads. We identify intriguing properties of retrieval heads:(1) universal: all the explored models with long-context capability have a set of retrieval heads; (2) sparse: only a small portion (less than 5\\%) of the attention heads are retrieval. (3) intrinsic: retrieval heads already exist in models pretrained with short context. When extending the context length by continual pretraining, it is still the same set of heads that perform information retrieval. (4) dynamically activated: take Llama-2 7B for example, 12 retrieval heads always attend to the required information no matter how the context is changed. The rest of the retrieval heads are activated in different contexts. (5) causal: completely pruning retrieval heads leads to failure in retrieving relevant information and results in hallucination, while pruning random non-retrieval heads does not affect the model's retrieval ability. We further show that retrieval heads strongly influence chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, where the model needs to frequently refer back the question and previously-generated context. Conversely, tasks where the model directly generates the answer using its intrinsic knowledge are less impacted by masking out retrieval heads. These observations collectively explain which internal part of the model seeks information from the input tokens. We believe our insights will foster future research on reducing hallucination, improving reasoning, and compressing the KV cache.","sentences":["Despite the recent progress in long-context language models, it remains elusive how transformer-based models exhibit the capability to retrieve relevant information from arbitrary locations within the long context.","This paper aims to address this question.","Our systematic investigation across a wide spectrum of models reveals that a special type of attention heads are largely responsible for retrieving information, which we dub retrieval heads.","We identify intriguing properties of retrieval heads:(1) universal: all the explored models with long-context capability have a set of retrieval heads; (2) sparse: only a small portion (less than 5\\%) of the attention heads are retrieval.","(3) intrinsic: retrieval heads already exist in models pretrained with short context.","When extending the context length by continual pretraining, it is still the same set of heads that perform information retrieval.","(4) dynamically activated: take Llama-2 7B for example, 12 retrieval heads always attend to the required information no matter how the context is changed.","The rest of the retrieval heads are activated in different contexts.","(5) causal: completely pruning retrieval heads leads to failure in retrieving relevant information and results in hallucination, while pruning random non-retrieval heads does not affect the model's retrieval ability.","We further show that retrieval heads strongly influence chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, where the model needs to frequently refer back the question and previously-generated context.","Conversely, tasks where the model directly generates the answer using its intrinsic knowledge are less impacted by masking out retrieval heads.","These observations collectively explain which internal part of the model seeks information from the input tokens.","We believe our insights will foster future research on reducing hallucination, improving reasoning, and compressing the KV cache."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15574v1","category":"cs.CL"}

(SPAA 2022) presented a distributed algorithm for multiplying sparse $n \\times n$ matrices, using $n$ computers. They assumed that the input matrices are uniformly sparse -- there are at most $d$ non-zeros in each row and column -- and the task is to compute a uniformly sparse part of the product matrix. Initially each computer knows one row of each input matrix, and eventually each computer needs to know one row of the product matrix. In each communication round each computer can send and receive one $O(\\log n)$-bit message. Their algorithm solves this task in $O(d^{1.907})$ rounds, while the trivial bound is $O(d^2)$. We improve on the prior work in two dimensions: First, we show that we can solve the same task faster, in only $O(d^{1.832})$ rounds. Second, we explore what happens when matrices are not uniformly sparse. We consider the following alternative notions of sparsity: row-sparse matrices (at most $d$ non-zeros per row), column-sparse matrices, matrices with bounded degeneracy (we can recursively delete a row or column with at most $d$ non-zeros), average-sparse matrices (at most $dn$ non-zeros in total), and general matrices.

However, LIGO's high sensitivity makes it susceptible to transient noises known as glitches, which necessitate effective differentiation from real gravitational wave signals. Traditional approaches predominantly employ fully supervised or semi-supervised algorithms for the task of glitch classification and clustering. In the future task of identifying and classifying glitches across main and auxiliary channels, it is impractical to build a dataset with manually labeled ground-truth. In addition, the patterns of glitches can vary with time, generating new glitches without manual labels. In response to this challenge, we introduce the Cross-Temporal Spectrogram Autoencoder (CTSAE), a pioneering unsupervised method for the dimensionality reduction and clustering of gravitational wave glitches. CTSAE integrates a novel four-branch autoencoder with a hybrid of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViT). To further extract features across multi-branches, we introduce a novel multi-branch fusion method using the CLS (Class) token. Our model, trained and evaluated on the GravitySpy O3 dataset on the main channel, demonstrates superior performance in clustering tasks when compared to state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods.

But, can they really \"reason\" over the natural language? This question has been receiving significant research attention and many reasoning skills such as commonsense, numerical, and qualitative have been studied. However, the crucial skill pertaining to 'logical reasoning' has remained underexplored.

However, little is known about how cost-competitive these reactors would be compared to other technologies, or about which aspects of their designs offer the most value to a decarbonized power grid. We employ an electricity system optimization model and a case study of a decarbonized U.S. Eastern Interconnection circa 2050 to generate initial indicators of future economic value for advanced reactors and the sensitivity of future value to various design parameters, the availability of competing technologies, and the underlying policy environment.

Given the sensitive nature of customer or organizational data often used in feature-based analysis, it is crucial to ensure individual privacy to uphold trust and confidence. Despite its importance, privacy preservation in the context of inventory planning remains unexplored. A key challenge is the nonsmoothness of the newsvendor loss function, which sets it apart from existing work on privacy-preserving algorithms in other settings. This paper introduces a novel approach to estimate a privacy-preserving optimal inventory policy within the f-differential privacy framework, an extension of the classical $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-differential privacy with several appealing properties. We develop a clipped noisy gradient descent algorithm based on convolution smoothing for optimal inventory estimation to simultaneously address three main challenges: (1) unknown demand distribution and nonsmooth loss function; (2) provable privacy guarantees for individual-level data; and (3) desirable statistical precision. We derive finite-sample high-probability bounds for optimal policy parameter estimation and regret analysis. By leveraging the structure of the newsvendor problem, we attain a faster excess population risk bound compared to that obtained from an indiscriminate application of existing results for general nonsmooth convex loss. Our bound aligns with that for strongly convex and smooth loss function. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed new method can achieve desirable privacy protection with a marginal increase in cost.","sentences":["The data-driven newsvendor problem with features has recently emerged as a significant area of research, driven by the proliferation of data across various sectors such as retail, supply chains, e-commerce, and healthcare.","Given the sensitive nature of customer or organizational data often used in feature-based analysis, it is crucial to ensure individual privacy to uphold trust and confidence.","Despite its importance, privacy preservation in the context of inventory planning remains unexplored.","A key challenge is the nonsmoothness of the newsvendor loss function, which sets it apart from existing work on privacy-preserving algorithms in other settings.","This paper introduces a novel approach to estimate a privacy-preserving optimal inventory policy within the f-differential privacy framework, an extension of the classical $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-differential privacy with several appealing properties.","We develop a clipped noisy gradient descent algorithm based on convolution smoothing for optimal inventory estimation to simultaneously address three main challenges: (1) unknown demand distribution and nonsmooth loss function; (2) provable privacy guarantees for individual-level data; and (3) desirable statistical precision.","We derive finite-sample high-probability bounds for optimal policy parameter estimation and regret analysis.","By leveraging the structure of the newsvendor problem, we attain a faster excess population risk bound compared to that obtained from an indiscriminate application of existing results for general nonsmooth convex loss.","Our bound aligns with that for strongly convex and smooth loss function.","Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed new method can achieve desirable privacy protection with a marginal increase in cost."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15466v1","category":"stat.ML"}

A major challenge to investigation of AM part-compromises comes from the difficulty in evaluating and benchmarking both identified threat vectors as well as methods for detecting adversarial actions. In this work, we introduce a generalized platform for systematic analysis of attacks against and defenses for 3D printers. Our \"OFFRAMPS\" platform is based on the open-source 3D printer control board \"RAMPS.\" OFFRAMPS allows analysis, recording, and modification of all control signals and I/O for a 3D printer. We show the efficacy of OFFRAMPS by presenting a series of case studies based on several Trojans, including ones identified in the literature, and show that OFFRAMPS can both emulate and detect these attacks, i.e., it can both change and detect arbitrary changes to the g-code print commands.","sentences":["Cybersecurity threats in Additive Manufacturing (AM) are an increasing concern as AM adoption continues to grow.","AM is now being used for parts in the aerospace, transportation, and medical domains.","Threat vectors which allow for part compromise are particularly concerning, as any failure in these domains would have life-threatening consequences.","A major challenge to investigation of AM part-compromises comes from the difficulty in evaluating and benchmarking both identified threat vectors as well as methods for detecting adversarial actions.","In this work, we introduce a generalized platform for systematic analysis of attacks against and defenses for 3D printers.","Our \"OFFRAMPS\" platform is based on the open-source 3D printer control board \"RAMPS.\"","OFFRAMPS allows analysis, recording, and modification of all control signals and I/O for a 3D printer.","We show the efficacy of OFFRAMPS by presenting a series of case studies based on several Trojans, including ones identified in the literature, and show that OFFRAMPS can both emulate and detect these attacks, i.e., it can both change and detect arbitrary changes to the g-code print commands."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15446v1","category":"cs.CR"}

These discoveries have completely revolutionized our understanding of planetary systems, revealing types of planets that do not exist in our solar system but are common in extrasolar systems, and a wide range of system architectures. Our solar system is clearly not the default for planetary systems. The community is now moving beyond basic characterization of exoplanets (mass, radius, and orbits) towards a deeper characterization of their atmospheres and even surfaces. With improved observational capabilities there is potential to now probe the geology of rocky exoplanets; this raises the possibility of an analogous revolution in our understanding of rocky planet evolution. However, characterizing the geology or geological processes occurring on rocky exoplanets is a major challenge, even with next generation telescopes. This chapter reviews what we may be able to accomplish with these efforts in the near-term and long-term. In the near-term, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revealing which rocky planets lose versus retain their atmospheres. This chapter discusses the implications of such discoveries, including how even planets with no or minimal atmospheres can still provide constraints on surface geology and long-term geological evolution. Longer-term possibilities are then reviewed, including whether the hypothesis of climate stabilization by the carbonate-silicate cycle can be tested by next generation telescopes. New modeling strategies sweeping through ranges of possibly evolutionary scenarios will be needed to use the current and future observations to constrain rocky exoplanet geology and evolution.","sentences":["Nearly 30 years after the discovery of the first exoplanet around a main sequence star, thousands of planets have now been confirmed.","These discoveries have completely revolutionized our understanding of planetary systems, revealing types of planets that do not exist in our solar system but are common in extrasolar systems, and a wide range of system architectures.","Our solar system is clearly not the default for planetary systems.","The community is now moving beyond basic characterization of exoplanets (mass, radius, and orbits) towards a deeper characterization of their atmospheres and even surfaces.","With improved observational capabilities there is potential to now probe the geology of rocky exoplanets; this raises the possibility of an analogous revolution in our understanding of rocky planet evolution.","However, characterizing the geology or geological processes occurring on rocky exoplanets is a major challenge, even with next generation telescopes.","This chapter reviews what we may be able to accomplish with these efforts in the near-term and long-term.","In the near-term, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revealing which rocky planets lose versus retain their atmospheres.","This chapter discusses the implications of such discoveries, including how even planets with no or minimal atmospheres can still provide constraints on surface geology and long-term geological evolution.","Longer-term possibilities are then reviewed, including whether the hypothesis of climate stabilization by the carbonate-silicate cycle can be tested by next generation telescopes.","New modeling strategies sweeping through ranges of possibly evolutionary scenarios will be needed to use the current and future observations to constrain rocky exoplanet geology and evolution."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15433v1","category":"astro-ph.EP"}

{"created":"2024-04-23 18:09:23","title":"The Open Effective Field Theory of Inflation","abstract":"In our quest to understand the generation of cosmological perturbations, we face two serious obstacles: we do not have direct information about the environment experienced by primordial perturbations during inflation, and our observables are practically limited to correlators of massless fields, heavier fields and derivatives decaying exponentially in the number of e-foldings. The flexible and general framework of open systems has been developed precisely to face similar challenges. Building on previous work, we develop a Schwinger-Keldysh path integral description for an open effective field theory of inflation, describing the possibly dissipative and non-unitary evolution of the Goldstone boson of time translations interacting with an unspecified environment, under the key assumption of locality in space and time. Working in the decoupling limit, we study the linear and interacting theory in de Sitter and derive predictions for the power spectrum and bispectrum that depend on a finite number of effective couplings organised in a derivative expansion.

A key prediction of SNR evolutionary models is the formation at the onset of the radiative stage of a cold, dense shell behind the forward shock.

Traditional lab analysis methods for mycotoxin detection can be time-consuming and may not always be suitable for large-scale screenings. However, in recent years, machine learning (ML) methods have gained popularity for use in the detection of mycotoxins and in the food safety industry in general, due to their accurate and timely predictions. We provide a systematic review on some of the recent ML applications for detecting/predicting the presence of mycotoxin on a variety of food ingredients, highlighting their advantages, challenges, and potential for future advancements.

Results show that the proposed model performs 12% better than the conventional vehicular route choice model based on the shortest path principle. Our empirical analysis of taxi drivers' routing behavior patterns in Beijing, China uncovers that drivers are inclined to choose routes with shorter time duration and with less loss at traversal intersections. Counterintuitively, we also found that drivers heavily rely on circuitous ring roads and expressways to deliver passengers, which are unexpectedly longer than the shortest paths.

We obtain flow velocity ground truths either by performing semi-automated particle tracking on samples with sparsely labeled filaments, or from passive tracer beads. We find that DLOF produces significantly more accurate velocity fields than PIV for densely labeled samples. We show that the breakdown of PIV arises because the algorithm cannot reliably distinguish contrast variations at high densities, particularly in directions parallel to the nematic director.

To this end, instead of considering a single capsule for each class and part, the proposed method employs several capsules (co-group capsules), capturing multiple prototypes of an object.

Extrasolar asteroids/comets/moons which have survived the evolution of their host star can end up in the atmosphere of the white dwarf. Asteroids and boulders appear to be the most common pollutants, where we use the term \"asteroids\" to refer to the parent body that is polluting the atmosphere. The presence of the planetary material is detected via absorption lines of heavy elements. White dwarfs with these absorption features are called \"polluted\" white dwarfs. Polluted white dwarfs were expected to be rare objects because white dwarfs have high surface gravities, therefore, these heavy elements will settle out of the white dwarf's atmospheres in a short amount of time (Paquette et al. 1986). However, high-resolution spectroscopic surveys found that 25-50% of white dwarfs are polluted (Zuckerman et al. 2003, 2010; Koester et al. 2014). The mechanism responsible for making a polluted white dwarf must be common and efficient. There is strong theoretical and observational evidence that white dwarfs are accreting from planetary material. There are different mechanisms that can deliver exoplanetary material into the Roche lobe of the white dwarf. Debris disks, transits from disintegrating bodies, and intact planets have all been detected around white dwarfs (e.g., Jura et al. 2007; Vanderburg et al. 2015, 2020). This chapter will describe how the chemical autopsies are conducted, and what is learnt about exoplanetary material from polluted white dwarfs.","sentences":["White dwarf planetary systems provide a unique way to measure the bulk composition of exoplanetary material.","Extrasolar asteroids/comets/moons which have survived the evolution of their host star can end up in the atmosphere of the white dwarf.","Asteroids and boulders appear to be the most common pollutants, where we use the term \"asteroids\" to refer to the parent body that is polluting the atmosphere.","The presence of the planetary material is detected via absorption lines of heavy elements.","White dwarfs with these absorption features are called \"polluted\" white dwarfs.","Polluted white dwarfs were expected to be rare objects because white dwarfs have high surface gravities, therefore, these heavy elements will settle out of the white dwarf's atmospheres in a short amount of time (Paquette et al. 1986).","However, high-resolution spectroscopic surveys found that 25-50% of white dwarfs are polluted (Zuckerman et al. 2003, 2010; Koester et al. 2014).","The mechanism responsible for making a polluted white dwarf must be common and efficient.","There is strong theoretical and observational evidence that white dwarfs are accreting from planetary material.","There are different mechanisms that can deliver exoplanetary material into the Roche lobe of the white dwarf.","Debris disks, transits from disintegrating bodies, and intact planets have all been detected around white dwarfs (e.g., Jura et al. 2007; Vanderburg et al. 2015, 2020).","This chapter will describe how the chemical autopsies are conducted, and what is learnt about exoplanetary material from polluted white dwarfs."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15425v1","category":"astro-ph.EP"}

However, existing methods, such as random walks on oriented simplices and homology, which capture these interactions, are not known to be efficient. This work investigates whether quantum walks on simplicial complexes exhibit quantum advantages. We introduce a novel quantum walk that encodes the combinatorial Laplacian, a key mathematical object whose spectral properties reflect the topology of the underlying simplicial complex. Furthermore, we construct a unitary encoding that projects onto the kernel of the Laplacian, representing the space of harmonic cycles in the complex's homology. Combined with the efficient construction of quantum walk unitaries for clique complexes that we present, this paves the way for utilizing quantum walks to explore higher-order interactions within topological structures. Our results achieve superpolynomial quantum speedup with quantum walks without relying on quantum oracles for large datasets.

We predict that there will be approximately $3$ times more unresolved than resolved LSNe Ia in the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the Rubin Observatory.

Capturing contextual information from textual data for event forecasting poses significant challenges due to the intricate structure of the documents and the evolving nature of events. Recently, dynamic Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been introduced to capture the dynamic patterns of input text graphs. However, these models only utilize node-level representation, causing the loss of the global information from graph-level representation. On the other hand, both node-level and graph-level representations are essential for effective event prediction as node-level representation gives insight into the local structure, and the graph-level representation provides an understanding of the global structure of the temporal graph. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Dynamic Graph Contrastive Learning (DyGCL) method for event prediction. Our model DyGCL employs a local view encoder to learn the evolving node representations, which effectively captures the local dynamic structure of input graphs. Additionally, it harnesses a global view encoder to perceive the hierarchical dynamic graph representation of the input graphs. Then we update the graph representations from both encoders using contrastive learning. In the final stage, DyGCL combines both representations using an attention mechanism and optimizes its capability to predict future events.

In this study, we demonstrate how the TBC of an interface is affected by the existence of a second interface, as well as how the thermal conductivity of a material is affected by the nearby materials. Using Si and Ge modeled by classical molecular dynamics simulations, the following phenomena are discovered. (1) The existence of a nearby interface can significantly change the TBC of the original interface. For example, by adding an interface after Si/Ge, the TBC can be increased from 400 to 700 MW/m2K. This is because the nearby interface serves as a filter of phonon modes, which selectively allows particular modes to pass through and affect the TBC of the original interfaces. This impact will disappear at the diffusive limit when the distance between interfaces is much longer than the phonon mean free path so that phonon modes recover equilibrium statistics before arriving at the second interface. (2) The thermal conductivity of a material can be significantly changed by the existence of neighboring materials. For example, a standalone 30-nm-thick Si's thermal conductivity can be increased from 50 to 280 W/mK, a more than 4-fold increase, beating the bulk thermal conductivity of Si, after being sandwiched between two Ge slabs. This is because the Ge slabs on the two sides serve as filters that only allow low-frequency phonons to transport heat in Si, which carry more heat than optical phonons. This work opens a new area of successive interface thermal transport and is expected to be important for nanoscale thermal characterization and thermal management.","sentences":["At the nanoscale, the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) and thermal conductivity are not intrinsic properties of interfaces or materials but depend on the nearby environment.","In this study, we demonstrate how the TBC of an interface is affected by the existence of a second interface, as well as how the thermal conductivity of a material is affected by the nearby materials.","Using Si and Ge modeled by classical molecular dynamics simulations, the following phenomena are discovered.","(1) The existence of a nearby interface can significantly change the TBC of the original interface.","For example, by adding an interface after Si/Ge, the TBC can be increased from 400 to 700 MW/m2K.

In this paper, we study the connected wedge theorem in two asymptotically AdS$_{2+1}$ spacetimes: the conical defect and BTZ black hole geometries. In these settings, we find that bulk scattering processes require not just large entanglement, but also additional restrictions related to candidate RT surfaces which are non-minimal.

Because bulk scattering relies on sub-AdS scale physics, this supports the idea that sub-AdS scale locality emerges from internal degrees of freedom.
