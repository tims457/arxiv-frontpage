We analyse the NICER data observed in between MJD 60095.19$-$60177.43, including one observation covered part of the long X-ray burst tail, i.e., $0.15-3.8$ hr after the trigger. The persistent spectra are quite similar and well described by a combination of multi-color disk blackbody, with the inner temperature of 0.5 keV, and a thermally comptonized continuum with the asymptotic power-law photon index of $\\Gamma\\sim2.2$, and electron temperature of $kT_{\\rm e}\\sim20-30$ keV. The persistent fluxes were around $3.8\\times10^{-10}~{\\rm erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$, corresponding to a local accretion rate of $1\\%~\\dot{m}_{\\rm Edd}$. Part of time-resolved burst spectra show a clear deviation from the blackbody model, which can be improved by considering the enhanced persistent emission due to the Poynting-Robertson drag, or the reflected disk emission illuminated by the burst.

We resimulate the initial conditions of five Milk Way-like systems taken from the Auriga project with and without stellar radiation, and study the effects of local stellar radiation on several properties of the galaxies and the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Similar to previous findings, we observe that local stellar radiation can modify gas cooling in the circumgalactic medium and thus suppress star formation and the surface densities of young stars and HI gas, while having little impact on the total gas content. Even though the magnitude of the effect we find is smaller than reported in earlier work, the radiation field is thus clearly an important component in simulations of late time galaxies. In particular, it also suppresses the peak of the rotation curve and reduces the mass of the stellar bulge.

The BAR(1) model is stationary and assumes process parameters to remain constant throughout the time period, which may be incompatible with the non-stationary real data, which indicates piecewise stationary characteristic. To better analyze the non-stationary bounded count time series, this article introduces the BAR(1) process with multiple change-points, which contains the BAR(1) model as a special case. Our primary goals are not only to detect the change-points, but also to give a solution to estimate the number and locations of the change-points. For this, the cumulative sum (CUSUM) test and minimum description length (MDL) principle are employed to deal with the testing and estimation problems. The proposed approaches are also applied to analysis of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices of the European Union.","sentences":["The first-order binomial autoregressive (BAR(1)) model is the most frequently used tool to analyze the bounded count time series.","The BAR(1) model is stationary and assumes process parameters to remain constant throughout the time period, which may be incompatible with the non-stationary real data, which indicates piecewise stationary characteristic.","To better analyze the non-stationary bounded count time series, this article introduces the BAR(1) process with multiple change-points, which contains the BAR(1) model as a special case.","Our primary goals are not only to detect the change-points, but also to give a solution to estimate the number and locations of the change-points.","For this, the cumulative sum (CUSUM) test and minimum description length (MDL) principle are employed to deal with the testing and estimation problems.","The proposed approaches are also applied to analysis of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices of the European Union."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13825v1","category":"stat.ME"}
