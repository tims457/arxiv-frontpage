Specifically, we aim to maximize profit over an arbitrary sequence of multiple demand curves, each dependent on a distinct ancillary variable, but sharing the same price. A prototypical example is targeted marketing, where a firm (seller) wishes to sell a product over multiple markets. The firm may invest different marketing expenditures for different markets to optimize customer acquisition, but must maintain the same price across all markets. Moreover, markets may have heterogeneous demand curves, each responding to prices and marketing expenditures differently. The firm's objective is to maximize its gross profit, the total revenue minus marketing costs.   Our results are near-optimal algorithms for this class of problems in an adversarial bandit setting, where demand curves are arbitrary non-adaptive sequences, and the firm observes only noisy evaluations of chosen points on the demand curves. We prove a regret upper bound of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\big(nT^{3/4}\\big)$ and a lower bound of $\\Omega\\big((nT)^{3/4}\\big)$ for monotonic demand curves, and a regret bound of $\\widetilde{\\Theta}\\big(nT^{2/3}\\big)$ for demands curves that are monotonic in price and concave in the ancillary variables.","sentences":["We study a sequential profit-maximization problem, optimizing for both price and ancillary variables like marketing expenditures.","Specifically, we aim to maximize profit over an arbitrary sequence of multiple demand curves, each dependent on a distinct ancillary variable, but sharing the same price.","A prototypical example is targeted marketing, where a firm (seller) wishes to sell a product over multiple markets.","The firm may invest different marketing expenditures for different markets to optimize customer acquisition, but must maintain the same price across all markets.","Moreover, markets may have heterogeneous demand curves, each responding to prices and marketing expenditures differently.","The firm's objective is to maximize its gross profit, the total revenue minus marketing costs.

This paper selects a sample of Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2021, empirically analyses the specific impact of the gap between words and deeds in digital transformation (GDT) on the stock price crash risk, and explores the possible causes of GDT. We found that GDT significantly increases the stock price crash risk, and this finding is still valid after a series of robustness tests. In a further study, a deeper examination of the causes of GDT reveals that firms' perceptions of economic policy uncertainty significantly increase GDT, and the effect is more pronounced in the sample of loss-making firms. At the same time, the results of the heterogeneity test suggest that investors are more tolerant of state-owned enterprises when they are in the GDT situation. Taken together, we provide a concrete bridge between the two measures of digital transformation - digital text frequency and digital technology share - and offer new insights to enhance capital market stability.","sentences":["The contrast between companies' \"fleshy\" promises and the \"skeletal\" performance in digital transformation may lead to a higher risk of stock price crash.","This paper selects a sample of Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2021, empirically analyses the specific impact of the gap between words and deeds in digital transformation (GDT) on the stock price crash risk, and explores the possible causes of GDT.","We found that GDT significantly increases the stock price crash risk, and this finding is still valid after a series of robustness tests.","In a further study, a deeper examination of the causes of GDT reveals that firms' perceptions of economic policy uncertainty significantly increase GDT, and the effect is more pronounced in the sample of loss-making firms.","At the same time, the results of the heterogeneity test suggest that investors are more tolerant of state-owned enterprises when they are in the GDT situation.","Taken together, we provide a concrete bridge between the two measures of digital transformation - digital text frequency and digital technology share - and offer new insights to enhance capital market stability."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01360v1","category":"q-fin.ST"}

The terminology \"bridge'' refers to a probability law that suitably interpolates such marginals. The theory plays a pivotal role in a variety of contemporary developments in machine learning, stochastic control, thermodynamics, and biology, to name a few, impacting disciplines such as single-cell genomics, meteorology, and robotics. In this work, we extend Schr\\\"odinger's paradigm of bridges to account for integral constraints along paths, in a way akin to Maximum Caliber - a Maximum Entropy principle applied in a dynamic context. The Maximum Caliber principle has proven useful to infer the dynamics of complex systems e.g., that model gene circuits and protein folding. We unify these two problems via a maximum likelihood formulation to reconcile stochastic dynamics with ensemble-path data. A variety of data types can be encompassed, ranging from distribution moments to average currents along paths. The framework enables inference of time-varying potential landscapes that drive the process. The resulting forces can be interpreted as the optimal control that drives the system in a way that abides by specified integral constraints. Analogous results are presented in a discrete-time, discrete-space setting and specialized to steady-state dynamics. We finish by illustrating the practical applicability of the framework through paradigmatic examples, such as that of bit erasure or protein folding. In doing so, we highlight the strengths of the proposed framework, namely, the generality of the theory, the ease of computation, and the ability to interpret results in terms of system dynamics. This is in contrast to Maximum-Caliber problems where the focus is typically on updating a probability law on paths.","sentences":["Schr\\\"odinger bridges have emerged as an enabling framework for unveiling the stochastic dynamics of systems based on marginal observations at different points in time.","The terminology \"bridge'' refers to a probability law that suitably interpolates such marginals.","The theory plays a pivotal role in a variety of contemporary developments in machine learning, stochastic control, thermodynamics, and biology, to name a few, impacting disciplines such as single-cell genomics, meteorology, and robotics.","In this work, we extend Schr\\\"odinger's paradigm of bridges to account for integral constraints along paths, in a way akin to Maximum Caliber - a Maximum Entropy principle applied in a dynamic context.","The Maximum Caliber principle has proven useful to infer the dynamics of complex systems e.g., that model gene circuits and protein folding.","We unify these two problems via a maximum likelihood formulation to reconcile stochastic dynamics with ensemble-path data.","A variety of data types can be encompassed, ranging from distribution moments to average currents along paths.","The framework enables inference of time-varying potential landscapes that drive the process.","The resulting forces can be interpreted as the optimal control that drives the system in a way that abides by specified integral constraints.","Analogous results are presented in a discrete-time, discrete-space setting and specialized to steady-state dynamics.","We finish by illustrating the practical applicability of the framework through paradigmatic examples, such as that of bit erasure or protein folding.","In doing so, we highlight the strengths of the proposed framework, namely, the generality of the theory, the ease of computation, and the ability to interpret results in terms of system dynamics.","This is in contrast to Maximum-Caliber problems where the focus is typically on updating a probability law on paths."],"url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01357v1","category":"cond-mat.stat-mech"}
{"created":"2024-03-03 01:36:11","title":"Enhancing Retinal Vascular Structure Segmentation in Images With a Novel Design Two-Path Interactive Fusion Module Model","abstract":"Precision in identifying and differentiating micro and macro blood vessels in the retina is crucial for the diagnosis of retinal diseases, although it poses a significant challenge. Current autoencoding-based segmentation approaches encounter limitations as they are constrained by the encoder and undergo a reduction in resolution during the encoding stage. The inability to recover lost information in the decoding phase further impedes these approaches. Consequently, their capacity to extract the retinal microvascular structure is restricted. To address this issue, we introduce Swin-Res-Net, a specialized module designed to enhance the precision of retinal vessel segmentation. Swin-Res-Net utilizes the Swin transformer which uses shifted windows with displacement for partitioning, to reduce network complexity and accelerate model convergence. Additionally, the model incorporates interactive fusion with a functional module in the Res2Net architecture. The Res2Net leverages multi-scale techniques to enlarge the receptive field of the convolutional kernel, enabling the extraction of additional semantic information from the image. This combination creates a new module that enhances the localization and separation of micro vessels in the retina. To improve the efficiency of processing vascular information, we've added a module to eliminate redundant information between the encoding and decoding steps.   Our proposed architecture produces outstanding results, either meeting or surpassing those of other published models. The AUC reflects significant enhancements, achieving values of 0.9956, 0.9931, and 0.9946 in pixel-wise segmentation of retinal vessels across three widely utilized datasets: CHASE-DB1, DRIVE, and STARE, respectively. Moreover, Swin-Res-Net outperforms alternative architectures, demonstrating superior performance in both IOU and F1 measure metrics.","sentences":["Precision in identifying and differentiating micro and macro blood vessels in the retina is crucial for the diagnosis of retinal diseases, although it poses a significant challenge.","Current autoencoding-based segmentation approaches encounter limitations as they are constrained by the encoder and undergo a reduction in resolution during the encoding stage.","The inability to recover lost information in the decoding phase further impedes these approaches.","Consequently, their capacity to extract the retinal microvascular structure is restricted.","To address this issue, we introduce Swin-Res-Net, a specialized module designed to enhance the precision of retinal vessel segmentation.","Swin-Res-Net utilizes the Swin transformer which uses shifted windows with displacement for partitioning, to reduce network complexity and accelerate model convergence.","Additionally, the model incorporates interactive fusion with a functional module in the Res2Net architecture.","The Res2Net leverages multi-scale techniques to enlarge the receptive field of the convolutional kernel, enabling the extraction of additional semantic information from the image.","This combination creates a new module that enhances the localization and separation of micro vessels in the retina.","To improve the efficiency of processing vascular information, we've added a module to eliminate redundant information between the encoding and decoding steps.
