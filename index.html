                  <p>Stochastic Nonlinear Optimal Control (SNOC) involves minimizing a cost function that averages out the random uncertainties affecting the dynamics of nonlinear systems.For tractability reasons, this problem is typically addressed by minimizing an empirical cost, which represents the average cost across a finite dataset of sampled disturbances.However, this approach raises the challenge of quantifying the control performance against out-of-sample uncertainties.Particularly, in scenarios where the training dataset is small, SNOC policies are prone to overfitting, resulting in significant discrepancies between the empirical cost and the true cost, i.e., the average SNOC cost incurred during control deployment.Therefore, establishing generalization bounds on the true cost is crucial for ensuring reliability in real-world applications.In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that leverages PAC-Bayes theory to provide rigorous generalization bounds for SNOC.Based on these bounds, we propose a new method for designing optimal controllers, offering a principled way to incorporate prior knowledge into the synthesis process, which aids in improving the control policy and mitigating overfitting.Furthermore, by leveraging recent parametrizations of stabilizing controllers for nonlinear systems, our framework inherently ensures closed-loop stability.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The effectiveness of our proposed method in incorporating prior knowledge and combating overfitting is shown by designing neural network controllers for tasks in cooperative robotics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span></p>

                  <p>Non-prehensile planar pushing is a challenging task due to its underactuated nature with hybrid-dynamics, where a robot needs to reason about an object's long-term behaviour and contact-switching, while being robust to contact uncertainty.The presence of clutter in the environment further complicates this task, introducing the need to include more sophisticated spatial analysis to avoid collisions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building upon prior work on reinforcement learning (RL) with multimodal categorical exploration for planar pushing, in this paper we incorporate location-based attention to enable robust navigation through clutter. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span>Unlike previous RL literature addressing this obstacle avoidance pushing task, our framework requires no predefined global paths and considers the target orientation of the manipulated object.Our results demonstrate that the learned policies successfully navigate through a wide range of complex obstacle configurations, including dynamic obstacles, with smooth motions, achieving the desired target object pose.We also validate the transferability of the learned policies to robotic hardware using the KUKA iiwa robot arm.</p>
