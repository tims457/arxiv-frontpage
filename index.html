                  <p>Adapting the user interface (UI) of software systems to meet the needs and preferences of users is a complex task.The main challenge is to provide the appropriate adaptations at the appropriate time to offer value to end-users.Recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) techniques may provide effective means to support the adaptation process.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we instantiate a reference framework for Intelligent User Interface Adaptation by using Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the ML component to adapt user interfaces and ultimately improving the overall User Experience (UX). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.83</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By using RL, the system is able to learn from past adaptations to improve the decision-making capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.836</span></span>Moreover, assessing the success of such adaptations remains a challenge.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To overcome this issue, we propose to use predictive Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) models to evaluate the outcome of each action (ie adaptations) performed by the RL agent. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span>In addition, we present an implementation of the instantiated framework, which is an extension of OpenAI Gym, that serves as a toolkit for developing and comparing RL algorithms.This Gym environment is highly configurable and extensible to other UI adaptation contexts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The evaluation results show that our RL-based framework can successfully train RL agents able to learn how to adapt UIs in a specific context to maximize the user engagement by using an HCI model as rewards predictor. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.83</span></span></p>
