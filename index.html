                  <p>Growing concerns about the AI alignment problem have emerged in recent years, with previous work focusing mainly on (1) qualitative descriptions of the alignment problem; (2) attempting to align AI actions with human interests by focusing on value specification and learning; and/or (3) focusing on a single agent or on humanity as a singular unit.Recent work in sociotechnical AI alignment has made some progress in defining alignment inclusively, but the field as a whole still lacks a systematic understanding of how to specify, describe, and analyze misalignment among entities, which may include individual humans, AI agents, and complex compositional entities such as corporations, nation-states, and so forth.Previous work on controversy in computational social science offers a mathematical model of contention among populations (of humans).In this paper, we adapt this contention model to the alignment problem, and show how misalignment can vary depending on the population of agents (human or otherwise) being observed, the domain in question, and the agents' probability-weighted preferences between possible outcomes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our model departs from value specification approaches and focuses instead on the morass of complex, interlocking, sometimes contradictory goals that agents may have in practice. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.821</span></span>We apply our model by analyzing several case studies ranging from social media moderation to autonomous vehicle behavior.By applying our model with appropriately representative value data, AI engineers can ensure that their systems learn values maximally aligned with diverse human interests.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Training autonomous agents with sparse rewards is a long-standing problem in online reinforcement learning (RL), due to low data efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.843</span></span>Prior work overcomes this challenge by extracting useful knowledge from offline data, often accomplished through the learning of action distribution from offline data and utilizing the learned distribution to facilitate online RL.However, since the offline data are given and fixed, the extracted knowledge is inherently limited, making it difficult to generalize to new tasks.We propose a novel approach that leverages offline data to learn a generative diffusion model, coined as Adaptive Trajectory Diffuser (ATraDiff).This model generates synthetic trajectories, serving as a form of data augmentation and consequently enhancing the performance of online RL methods.The key strength of our diffuser lies in its adaptability, allowing it to effectively handle varying trajectory lengths and mitigate distribution shifts between online and offline data.Because of its simplicity, ATraDiff seamlessly integrates with a wide spectrum of RL methods.Empirical evaluation shows that ATraDiff consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of environments, with particularly pronounced improvements in complicated settings.Our code and demo video are available at https://atradiff.github.io .</p>

                  <p>\Ac{MPC} and \ac{RL} are two powerful control strategies with, arguably, complementary advantages.In this work, we show how actor-critic \ac{RL} techniques can be leveraged to improve the performance of \ac{MPC}.The \ac{RL} critic is used as an approximation of the optimal value function, and an actor roll-out provides an initial guess for primal variables of the \ac{MPC}.A parallel control architecture is proposed where each \ac{MPC} instance is solved twice for different initial guesses.Besides the actor roll-out initialization, a shifted initialization from the previous solution is used.Thereafter, the actor and the critic are again used to approximately evaluate the infinite horizon cost of these trajectories.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The control actions from the lowest-cost trajectory are applied to the system at each time step. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.833</span></span>We establish that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to outperform the original \ac{RL} policy plus an error term that depends on the accuracy of the critic and decays with the horizon length of the \ac{MPC} formulation.Moreover, we do not require globally optimal solutions for these guarantees to hold.The approach is demonstrated on an illustrative toy example and an \ac{AD} overtaking scenario.</p>

                A Multiscale Perspective on Maximum Marginal Likelihood Estimation

                  <p>In this paper, we provide a multiscale perspective on the problem of maximum marginal likelihood estimation.We consider and analyse a diffusion-based maximum marginal likelihood estimation scheme using ideas from multiscale dynamics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our perspective is based on stochastic averaging; we make an explicit connection between ideas in applied probability and parameter inference in computational statistics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.836</span></span>In particular, we consider a general class of coupled Langevin diffusions for joint inference of latent variables and parameters in statistical models, where the latent variables are sampled from a fast Langevin process (which acts as a sampler), and the parameters are updated using a slow Langevin process (which acts as an optimiser).We show that the resulting system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) can be viewed as a two-time scale system.To demonstrate the utility of such a perspective, we show that the averaged parameter dynamics obtained in the limit of scale separation can be used to estimate the optimal parameter, within the strongly convex setting.We do this by using recent uniform-in-time non-asymptotic averaging bounds.Finally, we conclude by showing that the slow-fast algorithm we consider here, termed Slow-Fast Langevin Algorithm, performs on par with state-of-the-art methods on a variety of examples.We believe that the stochastic averaging approach we provide in this paper enables us to look at these algorithms from a fresh angle, as well as unlocking the path to develop and analyse new methods using well-established averaging principles.</p>
