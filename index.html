                  <p>Sand is a highly dissipative system, where the local spatial arrangements and densities depend strongly on the applied forces, resulting in fluid-like or solid-like behaviour.This makes sand swimming challenging and intriguing, raising questions about the nature of the motion and how to optimize the design of artificial swimmers able to swim in sand.Recent experiments suggest that lateral undulatory motion enables efficient locomotion, with a non-monotonic dependence of the swimming speed on the undulatory frequency and the height of the sediment bed.Here, we propose a quasi-2D granular model, where the effect of the bed height is modeled by a coarse-grained frictional force with the substrate.We show that the optimal frequency coincides with the second vibrational mode of the swimmer and explain the underlying mechanism through a characterization of the rheology of the medium.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Potential implications in the design of artificial swimmers are discussed. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.827</span></span></p>
