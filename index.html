                  <p>We present the All-Seeing Project V2: a new model and dataset designed for understanding object relations in images.Specifically, we propose the All-Seeing Model V2 (ASMv2) that integrates the formulation of text generation, object localization, and relation comprehension into a relation conversation (ReC) task.Leveraging this unified task, our model excels not only in perceiving and recognizing all objects within the image but also in grasping the intricate relation graph between them, diminishing the relation hallucination often encountered by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To facilitate training and evaluation of MLLMs in relation understanding, we created the first high-quality ReC dataset ({AS-V2) which is aligned with the format of standard instruction tuning data.In addition, we design a new benchmark, termed Circular-based Relation Probing Evaluation (CRPE) for comprehensively evaluating the relation comprehension capabilities of MLLMs.Notably, our ASMv2 achieves an overall accuracy of 52.04 on this relation-aware benchmark, surpassing the 43.14 of LLaVA-1.5 by a large margin.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We hope that our work can inspire more future research and contribute to the evolution towards artificial general intelligence. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.869</span></span>Our project is released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/all-seeing.</p>

                  <p>The assessment of safety performance plays a pivotal role in the development and deployment of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs).A common approach involves designing testing scenarios based on prior knowledge of CAVs (e.g., surrogate models), conducting tests in these scenarios, and subsequently evaluating CAVs' safety performances.However, substantial differences between CAVs and the prior knowledge can significantly diminish the evaluation efficiency.In response to this issue, existing studies predominantly concentrate on the adaptive design of testing scenarios during the CAV testing process.Yet, these methods have limitations in their applicability to high-dimensional scenarios.To overcome this challenge, we develop an adaptive testing environment that bolsters evaluation robustness by incorporating multiple surrogate models and optimizing the combination coefficients of these surrogate models to enhance evaluation efficiency.We formulate the optimization problem as a regression task utilizing quadratic programming.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To efficiently obtain the regression target via reinforcement learning, we propose the dense reinforcement learning method and devise a new adaptive policy with high sample efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span>Essentially, our approach centers on learning the values of critical scenes displaying substantial surrogate-to-real gaps.The effectiveness of our method is validated in high-dimensional overtaking scenarios, demonstrating that our approach achieves notable evaluation efficiency.</p>

                  <p>A broad use case of large language models (LLMs) is in goal-directed decision-making tasks (or "agent" tasks), where an LLM needs to not just generate completions for a given prompt, but rather make intelligent decisions over a multi-turn interaction to accomplish a task (e.g., when interacting with the web, using tools, or providing customer support).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a general paradigm to address such agent tasks, but current RL methods for LLMs largely focus on optimizing single-turn rewards. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.883</span></span>By construction, most single-turn RL methods cannot endow LLMs with the ability to intelligently seek information over multiple turns, perform credit assignment, or reason about their past actions -- all of which are critical in agent tasks.This raises the question: how can we design effective and efficient multi-turn RL algorithms for LLMs?In this paper, we develop a framework for building multi-turn RL algorithms for fine-tuning LLMs, that preserves the flexibility of existing single-turn RL methods for LLMs (e.g., proximal policy optimization), while accommodating multiple turns, long horizons, and delayed rewards effectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To do this, our framework adopts a hierarchical RL approach and runs two RL algorithms in parallel: a high-level off-policy value-based RL algorithm to aggregate reward over utterances, and a low-level RL algorithm that utilizes this high-level value function to train a token policy within each utterance or turn. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span>Our hierarchical framework, Actor-Critic Framework with a Hierarchical Structure (ArCHer), can also give rise to other RL methods.Empirically, we find that ArCHer significantly improves efficiency and performance on agent tasks, attaining a sample efficiency of about 100x over existing methods, while also improving with larger model capacity (upto the 7 billion scale that we tested on).</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) hold great potential for many natural language applications but risk generating incorrect or toxic content.To probe when an LLM generates unwanted content, the current paradigm is to recruit a \textit{red team} of human testers to design input prompts (i.e., test cases) that elicit undesirable responses from LLMs.However, relying solely on human testers is expensive and time-consuming.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent works automate red teaming by training a separate red team LLM with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate test cases that maximize the chance of eliciting undesirable responses from the target LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.84</span></span>However, current RL methods are only able to generate a small number of effective test cases resulting in a low coverage of the span of prompts that elicit undesirable responses from the target LLM.To overcome this limitation, we draw a connection between the problem of increasing the coverage of generated test cases and the well-studied approach of curiosity-driven exploration that optimizes for novelty.Our method of curiosity-driven red teaming (CRT) achieves greater coverage of test cases while mantaining or increasing their effectiveness compared to existing methods.Our method, CRT successfully provokes toxic responses from LLaMA2 model that has been heavily fine-tuned using human preferences to avoid toxic outputs.Code is available at \url{https://github.com/Improbable-AI/curiosity_redteam}</p>

                  <p>The assessment of safety performance plays a pivotal role in the development and deployment of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs).A common approach involves designing testing scenarios based on prior knowledge of CAVs (e.g., surrogate models), conducting tests in these scenarios, and subsequently evaluating CAVs' safety performances.However, substantial differences between CAVs and the prior knowledge can significantly diminish the evaluation efficiency.In response to this issue, existing studies predominantly concentrate on the adaptive design of testing scenarios during the CAV testing process.Yet, these methods have limitations in their applicability to high-dimensional scenarios.To overcome this challenge, we develop an adaptive testing environment that bolsters evaluation robustness by incorporating multiple surrogate models and optimizing the combination coefficients of these surrogate models to enhance evaluation efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We formulate the optimization problem as a regression task utilizing quadratic programming. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span>To efficiently obtain the regression target via reinforcement learning, we propose the dense reinforcement learning method and devise a new adaptive policy with high sample efficiency.Essentially, our approach centers on learning the values of critical scenes displaying substantial surrogate-to-real gaps.The effectiveness of our method is validated in high-dimensional overtaking scenarios, demonstrating that our approach achieves notable evaluation efficiency.</p>
