Finally, we examine LfV datasets and benchmarks, before concluding the survey by discussing challenges and opportunities in LfV. Here, we advocate for scalable approaches that can leverage the full range of available data and that target the key benefits of LfV. Overall, we hope this survey will serve as a comprehensive reference for the emerging field of LfV, catalysing further research in the area, and ultimately facilitating progress towards obtaining general-purpose robots.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This research introduces Procedural Artificial Narrative using Generative AI (PANGeA), a structured approach for leveraging large language models (LLMs), guided by a game designer's high-level criteria, to generate narrative content for turn-based role-playing video games (RPGs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.831</span></span>Distinct from prior applications of LLMs used for video game design, PANGeA innovates by not only generating game level data (which includes, but is not limited to, setting, key items, and non-playable characters (NPCs)), but by also fostering dynamic, free-form interactions between the player and the environment that align with the procedural game narrative.The NPCs generated by PANGeA are personality-biased and express traits from the Big 5 Personality Model in their generated responses.PANGeA addresses challenges behind ingesting free-form text input, which can prompt LLM responses beyond the scope of the game narrative.A novel validation system that uses the LLM's intelligence evaluates text input and aligns generated responses with the unfolding narrative.Making these interactions possible, PANGeA is supported by a server that hosts a custom memory system that supplies context for augmenting generated responses thus aligning them with the procedural narrative.For its broad application, the server has a REST interface enabling any game engine to integrate directly with PANGeA, as well as an LLM interface adaptable with local or private LLMs.PANGeA's ability to foster dynamic narrative generation by aligning responses with the procedural narrative is demonstrated through an empirical study and ablation test of two versions of a demo game.These are, a custom, browser-based GPT and a Unity demo.As the results show, PANGeA holds potential to assist game designers in using LLMs to generate narrative-consistent content even when provided varied and unpredictable, free-form text input.</p>

We open with an overview of fundamental concepts relevant to the LfV-for-robotics setting.This includes a discussion of the exciting benefits LfV methods can offer (e.g., improved generalization beyond the available robot data) and commentary on key LfV challenges (e.g., challenges related to missing information in video and LfV distribution shifts).Our literature review begins with an analysis of video foundation model techniques that can extract knowledge from large, heterogeneous video datasets.Next, we review methods that specifically leverage video data for robot learning.Here, we categorise work according to which RL knowledge modality benefits from the use of video data.We additionally highlight techniques for mitigating LfV challenges, including reviewing action representations that address the issue of missing action labels in video.   Finally, we examine LfV datasets and benchmarks, before concluding the survey by discussing challenges and opportunities in LfV. Here, we advocate for scalable approaches that can leverage the full range of available data and that target the key benefits of LfV. Overall, we hope this survey will serve as a comprehensive reference for the emerging field of LfV, catalysing further research in the area, and ultimately facilitating progress towards obtaining general-purpose robots.</p>

                  <p>Predicting future trajectories of traffic agents accurately holds substantial importance in various applications such as autonomous driving.Previous methods commonly infer all future steps of an agent either recursively or simultaneously.However, the recursive strategy suffers from the accumulated error, while the simultaneous strategy overlooks the constraints among future steps, resulting in kinematically infeasible predictions.To address these issues, in this paper, we propose G2LTraj, a plug-and-play global-to-local generation approach for trajectory prediction.Specifically, we generate a series of global key steps that uniformly cover the entire future time range.Subsequently, the local intermediate steps between the adjacent key steps are recursively filled in.In this way, we prevent the accumulated error from propagating beyond the adjacent key steps.Moreover, to boost the kinematical feasibility, we not only introduce the spatial constraints among key steps but also strengthen the temporal constraints among the intermediate steps.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Finally, to ensure the optimal granularity of key steps, we design a selectable granularity strategy that caters to each predicted trajectory. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.826</span></span>Our G2LTraj significantly improves the performance of seven existing trajectory predictors across the ETH, UCY and nuScenes datasets.Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.Code will be available at https://github.com/Zhanwei-Z/G2LTraj.</p>

                  <p>We address the challenge of content diversity and controllability in pedestrian simulation for driving scenarios.Recent pedestrian animation frameworks have a significant limitation wherein they primarily focus on either following trajectory [46] or the content of the reference video [57], consequently overlooking the potential diversity of human motion within such scenarios.This limitation restricts the ability to generate pedestrian behaviors that exhibit a wider range of variations and realistic motions and therefore restricts its usage to provide rich motion content for other components in the driving simulation system, e.g., suddenly changed motion to which the autonomous vehicle should respond.In our approach, we strive to surpass the limitation by showcasing diverse human motions obtained from various sources, such as generated human motions, in addition to following the given trajectory.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The fundamental contribution of our framework lies in combining the motion tracking task with trajectory following, which enables the tracking of specific motion parts (e.g., upper body) while simultaneously following the given trajectory by a single policy. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.827</span></span>This way, we significantly enhance both the diversity of simulated human motion within the given scenario and the controllability of the content, including language-based control.Our framework facilitates the generation of a wide range of human motions, contributing to greater realism and adaptability in pedestrian simulations for driving scenarios.More information is on our project page https://wangjingbo1219.github.io/papers/CVPR2024_PACER_PLUS/PACERPLUSPage.html .</p>
