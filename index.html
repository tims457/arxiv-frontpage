                  <p>Millimeter-wave (mmWave) is a key enabler for next-generation transportation systems.However, in an urban city scenario, mmWave is highly susceptible to blockages and shadowing.Therefore, base station (BS) placement is a crucial task in the infrastructure design where coverage requirements need to be met while simultaneously supporting localisation.This work assumes a pre-deployed BS and another BS is required to be added to support both localisation accuracy and coverage rate in an urban city scenario.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To solve this complex multi-objective optimisation problem, we utilise deep reinforcement learning (DRL). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.836</span></span>Concretely, this work proposes: 1) a three-layered grid for state representation as the input of the DRL, which enables it to adapt to the changes in the wireless environment represented by changing the position of the pre-deployed BS, and 2) the design of a suitable reward function for the DRL agent to solve the multi-objective problem.Numerical analysis shows that the proposed deep Q-network (DQN) model can learn/adapt from the complex radio environment represented by the terrain map and provides the same/similar solution to the exhaustive search, which is used as a benchmark.In addition, we show that an exclusive optimisation of coverage rate does not result in improved localisation accuracy, and thus there is a trade-off between the two solutions.</p>
