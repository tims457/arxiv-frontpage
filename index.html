                  <p>Identifying optimal join orders (JOs) stands out as a key challenge in database research and engineering.Owing to the large search space, established classical methods rely on approximations and heuristics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent efforts have successfully explored reinforcement learning (RL) for JO. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.836</span></span>Likewise, quantum versions of RL have received considerable scientific attention.Yet, it is an open question if they can achieve sustainable, overall practical advantages with improved quantum processors.   In this paper, we present a novel approach that uses quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) for JO based on a hybrid variational quantum ansatz.It is able to handle general bushy join trees instead of resorting to simpler left-deep variants as compared to approaches based on quantum(-inspired) optimisation, yet requires multiple orders of magnitudes fewer qubits, which is a scarce resource even for post-NISQ systems.   Despite moderate circuit depth, the ansatz exceeds current NISQ capabilities, which requires an evaluation by numerical simulations.While QRL may not significantly outperform classical approaches in solving the JO problem with respect to result quality (albeit we see parity), we find a drastic reduction in required trainable parameters.This benefits practically relevant aspects ranging from shorter training times compared to classical RL, less involved classical optimisation passes, or better use of available training data, and fits data-stream and low-latency processing scenarios.Our comprehensive evaluation and careful discussion delivers a balanced perspective on possible practical quantum advantage, provides insights for future systemic approaches, and allows for quantitatively assessing trade-offs of quantum approaches for one of the most crucial problems of database management systems.</p>

                  <p>In recent times, an increasing number of researchers have been devoted to utilizing deep neural networks for end-to-end flight navigation.This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules.However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability.It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories.Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily.In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network.This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility.Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.84</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.834</span></span>Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network.This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist.As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p>
