                  <p>In recent years, particularly since the early 2020s, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as the most powerful AI tools in addressing a diverse range of challenges, from natural language processing to complex problem-solving in various domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In the field of tamper detection, LLMs are capable of identifying basic tampering activities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.894</span></span>To assess the capabilities of LLMs in more specialized domains, we have collected five different LLMs developed by various companies: GPT-4, LLaMA, Bard, ERNIE Bot 4.0, and Tongyi Qianwen.This diverse range of models allows for a comprehensive evaluation of their performance in detecting sophisticated tampering instances.We devised two domains of detection: AI-Generated Content (AIGC) detection and manipulation detection.AIGC detection aims to test the ability to distinguish whether an image is real or AI-generated.Manipulation detection, on the other hand, focuses on identifying tampered images.According to our experiments, most LLMs can identify composite pictures that are inconsistent with logic, and only more powerful LLMs can distinguish logical, but visible signs of tampering to the human eye.All of the LLMs can't identify carefully forged images and very realistic images generated by AI.In the area of tamper detection, LLMs still have a long way to go, particularly in reliably identifying highly sophisticated forgeries and AI-generated images that closely mimic reality.</p>

                  <p>When many body system in Classical Mechanics is described using bi-Hamiltonian for its group of particles which forms a coarse grained bead, the damping energy from the heat bath perturbs the motion of a particle which is along the trajectory of multiple Hamiltonian system simultaneously.As managing the coarse grained modeling of the suspended semiflexible polymer like single walled carbon nanotubes(SWCNT) in vacuum, the authors discovered that such interconnection between Hamiltonian systems as sharing a heat bath builds a strongly coupled system.The consequence of this interconnection is revealed to form certain form of cross correlated momentum in coarsed grained system as well as in the original atomic scales.In this paper, we adapt the framework of Stochastic Thermodynamics to describe the cross correlation of bi-Hamiltonian system which replicates the macroscopic behaviour of SWCNT under the Smoluchowski picture for cross correlation between Hamiltonian systems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The numerical experiments using collision between tubes confirms the derivation and the justification of the usage of the heat diffusion to compensate the abnormaly from cross correlated momentum. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.889</span></span></p>
