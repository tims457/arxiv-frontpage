                  <p>We introduce iMotion-LLM: a Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) with trajectory prediction, tailored to guide interactive multi-agent scenarios.Different from conventional motion prediction approaches, iMotion-LLM capitalizes on textual instructions as key inputs for generating contextually relevant trajectories.By enriching the real-world driving scenarios in the Waymo Open Dataset with textual motion instructions, we created InstructWaymo.Leveraging this dataset, iMotion-LLM integrates a pretrained LLM, fine-tuned with LoRA, to translate scene features into the LLM input space.iMotion-LLM offers significant advantages over conventional motion prediction models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>First, it can generate trajectories that align with the provided instructions if it is a feasible direction. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.835</span></span>Second, when given an infeasible direction, it can reject the instruction, thereby enhancing safety.These findings act as milestones in empowering autonomous navigation systems to interpret and predict the dynamics of multi-agent environments, laying the groundwork for future advancements in this field.</p>
