However, often relaxed versions of these constraints are needed, and this increases considerably the complexity of computing value-aligned policies.To obtain efficient algorithms that make value-aligned decisions considering admissibility relaxation, we propose the use of learning techniques, in particular, we have used constrained reinforcement learning algorithms.In this paper, we present two algorithms, $\epsilon\text{-}ADQL$ for strategies based on local alignment and its extension $\epsilon\text{-}CADQL$ for a sequence of decisions.We have validated their efficiency in a water distribution problem in a drought scenario.</p>

                  <p>Graph structures offer a versatile framework for representing diverse patterns in nature and complex systems, applicable across domains like molecular chemistry, social networks, and transportation systems.While diffusion models have excelled in generating various objects, generating graphs remains challenging.This thesis explores the potential of score-based generative models in generating such objects through a modelization as combinatorial complexes, which are powerful topological structures that encompass higher-order relationships.   In this thesis, we propose a unified framework by employing stochastic differential equations.We not only generalize the generation of complex objects such as graphs and hypergraphs, but we also unify existing generative modelling approaches such as Score Matching with Langevin dynamics and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This innovation overcomes limitations in existing frameworks that focus solely on graph generation, opening up new possibilities in generative AI.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.835</span></span>The experiment results showed that our framework could generate these complex objects, and could also compete against state-of-the-art approaches for mere graph and molecule generation tasks.</p>

                  <p>In dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) we seek to infer from time series measurements a generative model of the underlying dynamical process.This is a prime objective in any scientific discipline, where we are particularly interested in parsimonious models with a low parameter load.A common strategy here is parameter pruning, removing all parameters with small weights.However, here we find this strategy does not work for DSR, where even low magnitude parameters can contribute considerably to the system dynamics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>On the other hand, it is well known that many natural systems which generate complex dynamics, like the brain or ecological networks, have a sparse topology with comparatively few links. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.849</span></span>Inspired by this, we show that geometric pruning, where in contrast to magnitude-based pruning weights with a low contribution to an attractor's geometrical structure are removed, indeed manages to reduce parameter load substantially without significantly hampering DSR quality.We further find that the networks resulting from geometric pruning have a specific type of topology, and that this topology, and not the magnitude of weights, is what is most crucial to performance.We provide an algorithm that automatically generates such topologies which can be used as priors for generative modeling of dynamical systems by RNNs, and compare it to other well studied topologies like small-world or scale-free networks.</p>

                  <p>The emerging field of \emph{value awareness engineering} claims that software agents and systems should be value-aware, i.e. they must make decisions in accordance with human values.In this context, such agents must be capable of explicitly reasoning as to how far different courses of action are aligned with these values.For this purpose, values are often modelled as preferences over states or actions, which are then aggregated to determine the sequences of actions that are maximally aligned with a certain value.Recently, additional value admissibility constraints at this level have been considered as well.   However, often relaxed versions of these constraints are needed, and this increases considerably the complexity of computing value-aligned policies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To obtain efficient algorithms that make value-aligned decisions considering admissibility relaxation, we propose the use of learning techniques, in particular, we have used constrained reinforcement learning algorithms. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.833</span></span>In this paper, we present two algorithms, $\epsilon\text{-}ADQL$ for strategies based on local alignment and its extension $\epsilon\text{-}CADQL$ for a sequence of decisions.We have validated their efficiency in a water distribution problem in a drought scenario.</p>
