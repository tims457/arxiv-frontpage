                  <p>The self-simulational theory of temporal extension describes an information-theoretically formalized mechanism by which the width of subjective temporality emerges from the architecture of self-modelling.In this paper, the perspective of the free energy principle will be assumed, to cast the emergence of subjective temporality, along with a mechanism for duration estimation, from first principles of the physics of self-organization.Building on the transparent inferential format of self-modelling, it will be explained why subjective temporality feels like a genuine dimension, in which our life unfolds, as opposed to a mere mental construct, such as the mental number line.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using active inference, a deep parametric generative model of temporal inference is simulated, which realizes the described dynamics on a computational level. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.864</span></span>Two biases (i.e. variations) of time-perception naturally emerge from the simulation.This concerns the intentional binding effect (i.e. the subjective compression of the temporal interval between voluntarily initiated actions and subsequent sensory consequences) and empirically documented alterations of subjective time experience in deep and concentrated states of meditative absorption.Generally, numerous systematic and domain-specific variations of subjective time experience are computationally explained, as enabled by integration with current active inference accounts mapping onto the respective domains.This concerns the temporality modulating role of negative valence, impulsivity, boredom, flow-states, and near death-experiences, amongst others.The self-simulational theory of temporal extension, from the perspective of the free energy principle, explains how the subjective temporal Now emerges and varies from first principles, accounting for why sometimes, subjective time seems to fly, and sometimes, moments feel like eternities.</p>
