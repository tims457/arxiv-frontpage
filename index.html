                  <p>Building upon prior framework of computational Lacanian psychoanalysis with the theory of active inference, this paper aims to further explore the concept of self-identification and its potential applications.Beginning with two classic paradigms in psychology, mirror self-recognition and rubber hand illusion, we suggest that imaginary identification is characterized by an integrated body schema with minimal free energy.Next, we briefly survey three dimensions of symbolic identification (sociological, psychoanalytic, and linguistical) and corresponding active inference accounts.To provide intuition, we respectively employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) supervised by ChatGPT to showcase optimization of free energy during motor skill and language mastery underlying identification formation.We then introduce Lacan's Graph II of desire, unifying imaginary and symbolic identification, and propose an illustrative model called FreeAgent.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In concluding remarks, we discuss some key issues in the potential of computational Lacanian psychoanalysis to advance mental health and artificial intelligence, including digital twin mind, large language models as avatars of the Lacanian Other, and the feasibility of human-level artificial general intelligence with self-awareness in the context of post-structuralism. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.844</span></span></p>

                  <p>A semi--numerical approach proposed many years ago for describing gravitational collapse in the post--quasi--static approximation, is modified in order to avoid the numerical integration of the basic differential equations the approach is based upon.For doing that we have to impose some restrictions on the fluid distribution.More specifically, we shall assume the vanishing complexity factor condition, which allows for analytical integration of the pertinent differential equations and leads to physically interesting models.Instead, we show that neither the homologous nor the quasi--homologous evolution are acceptable since they lead to geodesic fluids, which are unsuitable for being described in the post--quasi--static approximation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Also, we prove that, within this approximation, adiabatic evolution also leads to geodesic fluids and therefore we shall consider exclusively dissipative systems. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.834</span></span>Besides the vanishing complexity factor condition, additional information is required for a full description of models.We shall propose different strategies for obtaining such an information, which are based on observables quantities (e.g. luminosity and redshift), and/or heuristic mathematical ansatz.To illustrate the method, we present two models.One model is inspired in the well known Schwarzschild interior solution, and another one is inspired in Tolman VI solution.</p>

                  <p>In the pursuit of transferring a source model to a target domain without access to the source training data, Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) has been extensively explored across various scenarios, including closed-set, open-set, partial-set, and generalized settings.Existing methods, focusing on specific scenarios, not only address only a subset of challenges but also necessitate prior knowledge of the target domain, significantly limiting their practical utility and deployability.In light of these considerations, we introduce a more practical yet challenging problem, termed unified SFDA, which comprehensively incorporates all specific scenarios in a unified manner.To tackle this unified SFDA problem, we propose a novel approach called Latent Causal Factors Discovery (LCFD).In contrast to previous alternatives that emphasize learning the statistical description of reality, we formulate LCFD from a causality perspective.The objective is to uncover the causal relationships between latent variables and model decisions, enhancing the reliability and robustness of the learned model against domain shifts.To integrate extensive world knowledge, we leverage a pre-trained vision-language model such as CLIP.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This aids in the formation and discovery of latent causal factors in the absence of supervision in the variation of distribution and semantics, coupled with a newly designed information bottleneck with theoretical guarantees. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.824</span></span>Extensive experiments demonstrate that LCFD can achieve new state-of-the-art results in distinct SFDA settings, as well as source-free out-of-distribution generalization.Our code and data are available at https://github.com/tntek/source-free-domain-adaptation.</p>
