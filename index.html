M3A can complete 30.6% of the AndroidWorld's tasks, leaving ample room for future work.Furthermore, we adapt a popular desktop web agent to work on Android, which we find to be less effective on mobile, suggesting future research is needed to achieve universal, cross-domain agents.Finally, we conduct a robustness analysis by testing M3A against a range of task variations on a representative subset of tasks, demonstrating that variations in task parameters can significantly alter the complexity of a task and therefore an agent's performance, highlighting the importance of testing agents under diverse conditions.AndroidWorld and the experiments in this paper are available at https://github.com/google-research/android_world.</p>

                  <p>Accurate reconstruction of complex dynamic scenes from just a single viewpoint continues to be a challenging task in computer vision.Current dynamic novel view synthesis methods typically require videos from many different camera viewpoints, necessitating careful recording setups, and significantly restricting their utility in the wild as well as in terms of embodied AI applications.In this paper, we propose $\textbf{GCD}$, a controllable monocular dynamic view synthesis pipeline that leverages large-scale diffusion priors to, given a video of any scene, generate a synchronous video from any other chosen perspective, conditioned on a set of relative camera pose parameters.Our model does not require depth as input, and does not explicitly model 3D scene geometry, instead performing end-to-end video-to-video translation in order to achieve its goal efficiently.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Despite being trained on synthetic multi-view video data only, zero-shot real-world generalization experiments show promising results in multiple domains, including robotics, object permanence, and driving environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span>We believe our framework can potentially unlock powerful applications in rich dynamic scene understanding, perception for robotics, and interactive 3D video viewing experiences for virtual reality.</p>

                  <p>Concerns about the effect of greenhouse gases have motivated the development of certification protocols to quantify the industrial carbon footprint (CF).These protocols are manual, work-intensive, and expensive.All of the above have led to a shift towards automatic data-driven approaches to estimate the CF, including Machine Learning (ML) solutions.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unfortunately, the decision-making processes involved in these solutions lack transparency from the end user's point of view, who must blindly trust their outcomes compared to intelligible traditional manual approaches. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.835</span></span>In this research, manual and automatic methodologies for CF estimation were reviewed, taking into account their transparency limitations.This analysis led to the proposal of a new explainable ML solution for automatic CF calculations through bank transaction classification.Consideration should be given to the fact that no previous research has considered the explainability of bank transaction classification for this purpose.For classification, different ML models have been employed based on their promising performance in the literature, such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Recursive Neural Networks.The results obtained were in the 90 % range for accuracy, precision, and recall evaluation metrics.From their decision paths, the proposed solution estimates the CO2 emissions associated with bank transactions.The explainability methodology is based on an agnostic evaluation of the influence of the input terms extracted from the descriptions of transactions using locally interpretable models.The explainability terms were automatically validated using a similarity metric over the descriptions of the target categories.Conclusively, the explanation performance is satisfactory in terms of the proximity of the explanations to the associated activity sector descriptions.</p>

                  <p>Recent advancements in generative models have sparked significant interest within the machine learning community.Particularly, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in synthesizing images and speech.Studies such as those by Lee et al.[19], Black et al.[4], Wang et al.[36], and Fan et al.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>[8] illustrate that Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) can enhance diffusion models for image synthesis. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span>However, due to architectural differences between these models and those employed in speech synthesis, it remains uncertain whether RLHF could similarly benefit speech synthesis models.In this paper, we explore the practical application of RLHF to diffusion-based text-to-speech synthesis, leveraging the mean opinion score (MOS) as predicted by UTokyo-SaruLab MOS prediction system [29] as a proxy loss.We introduce diffusion model loss-guided RL policy optimization (DLPO) and compare it against other RLHF approaches, employing the NISQA speech quality and naturalness assessment model[21] and human preference experiments for further evaluation.Our results show that RLHF can enhance diffusion-based text-to-speech synthesis models, and, moreover, DLPO can better improve diffusion models in generating natural and high quality speech audios.</p>
