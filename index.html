                  <p>Gradient Boost Decision Trees (GBDT) is a powerful additive model based on tree ensembles.Its nature makes GBDT a black-box model even though there are multiple explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) models obtaining information by reinterpreting the model globally and locally.Each tree of the ensemble is a transparent model itself but the final outcome is the result of a sum of these trees and it is not easy to clarify.   In this paper, a feature contribution method for GBDT is developed.The proposed method takes advantage of the GBDT architecture to calculate the contribution of each feature using the residue of each node.This algorithm allows to calculate the sequence of node decisions given a prediction.   Theoretical proofs and multiple experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the performance of our method which is not only a local explicability model for the GBDT algorithm but also a unique option that reflects GBDTs internal behavior.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposal is aligned to the contribution of characteristics having impact in some artificial intelligence problems such as ethical analysis of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and comply with the new European laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) about the right to explain and nondiscrimination. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.835</span></span></p>

In this paper, we present UR2M, a novel Uncertainty and Resource-aware event detection framework for MCUs.Specifically, we (i) develop an uncertainty-aware WED based on evidential theory for accurate event detection and reliable uncertainty estimation; (ii) introduce a cascade ML framework to achieve efficient model inference via early exits, by sharing shallower model layers among different event models; (iii) optimize the deployment of the model and MCU library for system efficiency.We conducted extensive experiments and compared UR2M to traditional uncertainty baselines using three wearable datasets.Our results demonstrate that UR2M achieves up to 864% faster inference speed, 857% energy-saving for uncertainty estimation, 55% memory saving on two popular MCUs, and a 22% improvement in uncertainty quantification performance.   UR2M can be deployed on a wide range of MCUs, significantly expanding real-time and reliable WED applications.</p>

                  <p>The human-like automatic deductive reasoning has always been one of the most challenging open problems in the interdiscipline of mathematics and artificial intelligence.This paper is the third in a series of our works.We built a neural-symbolic system, called FGeoDRL, to automatically perform human-like geometric deductive reasoning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The neural part is an AI agent based on reinforcement learning, capable of autonomously learning problem-solving methods from the feedback of a formalized environment, without the need for human supervision. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.851</span></span>It leverages a pre-trained natural language model to establish a policy network for theorem selection and employ Monte Carlo Tree Search for heuristic exploration.The symbolic part is a reinforcement learning environment based on geometry formalization theory and FormalGeo\cite{FormalGeo}, which models GPS as a Markov Decision Process\cite{MDP}.In this formal symbolic system, the known conditions and objectives of the problem form the state space, while the set of theorems forms the action space.Leveraging FGeoDRL, we have achieved readable and verifiable automated solutions to geometric problems.Experiments conducted on the formalgeo7k dataset have achieved a problem-solving success rate of 86.40\%.The project is available at https://github.com/PersonNoName/FGeoDRL.</p>
