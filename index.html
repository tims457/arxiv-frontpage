                  <p>Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models rely on 2D inputs, lacking integration with the broader realm of the 3D physical world.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, they perform action prediction by learning a direct mapping from perception to action, neglecting the vast dynamics of the world and the relations between actions and dynamics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.83</span></span>In contrast, human beings are endowed with world models that depict imagination about future scenarios to plan actions accordingly.To this end, we propose 3D-VLA by introducing a new family of embodied foundation models that seamlessly link 3D perception, reasoning, and action through a generative world model.Specifically, 3D-VLA is built on top of a 3D-based large language model (LLM), and a set of interaction tokens is introduced to engage with the embodied environment.Furthermore, to inject generation abilities into the model, we train a series of embodied diffusion models and align them into the LLM for predicting the goal images and point clouds.To train our 3D-VLA, we curate a large-scale 3D embodied instruction dataset by extracting vast 3D-related information from existing robotics datasets.Our experiments on held-in datasets demonstrate that 3D-VLA significantly improves the reasoning, multimodal generation, and planning capabilities in embodied environments, showcasing its potential in real-world applications.</p>
