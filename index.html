                  <p>Manipulation of wave propagation through open resonant systems has attracted tremendous interest.When accessible to the open system, the system under study is prone to tempering to out of equilibrium, and a lack of reciprocity is the rule rather than the exception.Open systems correspond to non-hermitian Hamiltonians with very unique properties such as resulting exceptional points and ideal isolation.Here, we have found a highly sensitive modulation for the intersection of resonant patch antennas with respect to cavity magnonic coupling by means of an open coupling system of three resonant modes.Two types of crossings are implemented in this study: the first type of crossing remotely controls the sharp switching of the transmission line 's transmittance, while regulating the repulsive behavior of its zero-reflection states.The second type of crossing corresponds to the modulation of non-reciprocal phase transitions, which enables a more desirable isolation effect.Three different coupling models are realized by a non-Hermitian scattering Hamiltonian, revealing distinct spatial overlaps between modes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This elucidates that dissipative coupling of at least two modes to the environment is crucial for non-reciprocal transport. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.836</span></span>Our work not only reveals the versatility of cavity magnonic systems but also provides a way to design functional devices for general wave optics using patch antenna crossings.</p>

                  <p>This paper aims to develop a learning method for a special class of traveling salesman problems (TSP), namely, the pickup-and-delivery TSP (PDTSP), which finds the shortest tour along a sequence of one-to-one pickup-and-delivery nodes.One-to-one here means that the transported people or goods are associated with designated pairs of pickup and delivery nodes, in contrast to that indistinguishable goods can be delivered to any nodes.In PDTSP, precedence constraints need to be satisfied that each pickup node must be visited before its corresponding delivery node.Classic operations research (OR) algorithms for PDTSP are difficult to scale to large-sized problems.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to TSPs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.838</span></span>The basic idea is to explore and evaluate visiting sequences in a solution space.However, this approach could be less computationally efficient, as it has to potentially evaluate many infeasible solutions of which precedence constraints are violated.To restrict solution search within a feasible space, we utilize operators that always map one feasible solution to another, without spending time exploring the infeasible solution space.Such operators are evaluated and selected as policies to solve PDTSPs in an RL framework.We make a comparison of our method and baselines, including classic OR algorithms and existing learning methods.Results show that our approach can find tours shorter than baselines.</p>

Managerially, our theory and simulations translate to the following insights.First, there is a principle of "learning less is more" in inventory management: depending on the amount of data available, it may be beneficial to restrict oneself to a simpler, albeit suboptimal, class of inventory policies to minimize overfitting errors.Second, the number of parameters in a policy class may not be the correct measure of overfitting error: in fact, the class of policies defined by T time-varying base-stock levels exhibits a generalization error comparable to that of the two-parameter (s, S) policy class.Finally, our research suggests situations in which it could be beneficial to incorporate the concepts of base-stock and inventory position into black-box learning machines, instead of having these machines directly learn the order quantity actions.</p>
