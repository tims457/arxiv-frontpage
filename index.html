In chapter 1, we introduce the notion of reverse differentiation, a term which describes the body of techniques which enables the efficient computation of gradients.We cover relevant techniques both in the deterministic and stochastic cases.We present a new framework for calculating the gradient of problems which involve both deterministic and stochastic elements.In chapter 2, we analyze the properties of the gradient estimator, with a focus on those properties which are typically assumed in convergence proofs of optimization algorithms.Chapter 3 gives various examples of applying our new gradient estimator.We further explore the idea of working with piecewise continuous models, that is, models with distinct branches and if statements which define what specific branch to use.</p>

                  <p>In biological evolution complex neural structures grow from a handful of cellular ingredients.As genomes in nature are bounded in size, this complexity is achieved by a growth process where cells communicate locally to decide whether to differentiate, proliferate and connect with other cells.This self-organisation is hypothesized to play an important part in the generalisation, and robustness of biological neural networks.Artificial neural networks (ANNs), on the other hand, are traditionally optimized in the space of weights.Thus, the benefits and challenges of growing artificial neural networks remain understudied.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Building on the previously introduced Neural Developmental Programs (NDP), in this work we present an algorithm for growing ANNs that solve reinforcement learning tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.845</span></span>We identify a key challenge: ensuring phenotypic complexity requires maintaining neuronal diversity, but this diversity comes at the cost of optimization stability.To address this, we introduce two mechanisms: (a) equipping neurons with an intrinsic state inherited upon neurogenesis; (b) lateral inhibition, a mechanism inspired by biological growth, which controlls the pace of growth, helping diversity persist.We show that both mechanisms contribute to neuronal diversity and that, equipped with them, NDPs achieve comparable results to existing direct and developmental encodings in complex locomotion tasks</p>

                  <p>It seems that in the current age, computers, computation, and data have an increasingly important role to play in scientific research and discovery.This is reflected in part by the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence, which have become great areas of interest not just for computer science but also for many other fields of study.More generally, there have been trends moving towards the use of bigger, more complex and higher capacity models.It also seems that stochastic models, and stochastic variants of existing deterministic models, have become important research directions in various fields.For all of these types of models, gradient-based optimization remains as the dominant paradigm for model fitting, control, and more.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This dissertation considers unconstrained, nonlinear optimization problems, with a focus on the gradient itself, that key quantity which enables the solution of such problems.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span>In chapter 1, we introduce the notion of reverse differentiation, a term which describes the body of techniques which enables the efficient computation of gradients.We cover relevant techniques both in the deterministic and stochastic cases.We present a new framework for calculating the gradient of problems which involve both deterministic and stochastic elements.In chapter 2, we analyze the properties of the gradient estimator, with a focus on those properties which are typically assumed in convergence proofs of optimization algorithms.Chapter 3 gives various examples of applying our new gradient estimator.We further explore the idea of working with piecewise continuous models, that is, models with distinct branches and if statements which define what specific branch to use.</p>

                Addressing Misspecification in Simulation-based Inference through Data-driven Calibration
