We introduce Hyper$^2$LTL$_f$, a temporal logic over finite traces that allows for second-order quantification over sets of traces.We study the monitoring problem in two fundamental execution models: (1) the parallel model, where a fixed number of traces is monitored in parallel, and (2) the sequential model, where an unbounded number of traces is observed sequentially, one trace after the other.For the parallel model, we show that the monitoring of the second-order hyperproperties of Hyper$^2$LTL$_f$ can be reduced to monitoring first-order hyperproperties.For the sequential model, we present a monitoring algorithm that handles second-order quantification efficiently, exploiting optimizations based on the monotonicity of subformulas, graph-based storing of executions, and fixpoint hashing.We present experimental results from a range of benchmarks, including examples from common knowledge and planning.</p>

                  <p>The complexity of the alignment problem stems from the fact that existing methods are unstable.Researchers continuously invent various tricks to address this shortcoming.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For instance, in the fundamental Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) technique of Language Model alignment, in addition to reward maximization, the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the trainable policy and the SFT policy is minimized. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.828</span></span>This addition prevents the model from being overfitted to the Reward Model (RM) and generating texts that are out-of-domain for the RM.The Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) method reformulates the optimization task of RLHF and eliminates the Reward Model while tacitly maintaining the requirement for the policy to be close to the SFT policy.In our paper, we argue that this implicit limitation in the DPO method leads to sub-optimal results.We propose a new method called Trust Region DPO (TR-DPO), which updates the reference policy during training.With such a straightforward update, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TR-DPO against DPO on the Anthropic HH and TLDR datasets.We show that TR-DPO outperforms DPO by up to 19%, measured by automatic evaluation with GPT-4.The new alignment approach that we propose allows us to improve the quality of models across several parameters at once, such as coherence, correctness, level of detail, helpfulness, and harmlessness.</p>

                  <p>It is notorious that quantum mechanics (QM) cannot predict well-defined values for all physical quantities.Less well-known, however, is the fact that QM is unable to furnish probabilistic predictions even in emblematic scenarios such as the double-slit experiment.In contrast, equipped with postulate trajectories, Bohmian mechanics (BM) has inherited more predictive power.It follows that, contrary to common belief, QM and BM are not just different interpretations but distinct theories.This work formalizes the aforementioned assertions and illustrates them through three case studies: (i) free particle, (ii) free fall under a uniform gravitational field, and (iii) the double-slit experiment.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, we introduce a prescription for constructing a flight-time probability distribution within generic trajectory-equipped theories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.82</span></span>We then apply our formalism to BM and derive probability distributions that are unreachable by QM.Our results can, in principle, be tested against real experiments, thereby assessing the validity of Bohmian trajectories.</p>
