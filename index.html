This paper introduces the design of a novel rotor UAV MorphoGear with morphogenetic gear and includes a description of the robot's mechanics, electronics, and control architecture, as well as walking behavior and an analysis of experimental results.MorphoGear is able to fly, walk on surfaces with several gaits, and grasp objects with four compatible robotic limbs.Robotic limbs with three degrees of freedom (DoFs) are used by this UAV as pedipulators when walking or flying and as manipulators when performing actions in the environment.We performed a locomotion analysis of the landing gear of the robot.Three types of robot gaits have been developed.   The experimental results revealed low crosstrack error of the most accurate gait (mean of 1.9 cm and max of 5.5 cm) and the ability of the drone to move with a 210 mm step length.Another type of robot gait also showed low crosstrack error (mean of 2.3 cm and max of 6.9 cm).The proposed MorphoGear system can potentially achieve a high scope of tasks in environmental surveying, delivery, and high-altitude operations.</p>

                  <p>In generic closed quantum systems, the complexity of operators increases under time evolution governed by the Heisenberg equation, reflecting the scrambling of local quantum information.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, when systems interact with an external environment, the system-environment coupling allows operators to escape from the system, inducing a dynamical transition between the scrambling phase and the dissipative phase. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.855</span></span>This transition is known as the environment-induced information scrambling transition, originally proposed in Majorana fermion systems.In this work, we advance this dicovery by investigating the transition in charge-conserved systems with space-time randomness.We construct solvable Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models of complex fermions coupled to an environment, enabling the analytical computation of operator growth.We determine the critical dissipation strength, which is proportional to $n(1-n)$ with $n$ being the density of the complex fermions, arising from the suppression in the quantum Lyapunov exponent due to the Pauli blockade in the scattering process.We further analyze the density dependence of maximally scrambled operators at late time.Our results shed light on the intriguing interplay between information scrambling, dissipation, and conservation laws.</p>

                  <p>Mounting a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) holds promise for improving traditional terrestrial network performance.Unlike conventional methods deploying passive RIS on UAVs, this study delves into the efficacy of an aerial active RIS (AARIS).Specifically, the downlink transmission of an AARIS network is investigated, where the base station (BS) leverages rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) for effective interference management and benefits from the support of an AARIS for jointly amplifying and reflecting the BS's transmit signals.Considering both the non-trivial energy consumption of the active RIS and the limited energy storage of the UAV, we propose an innovative element selection strategy for optimizing the on/off status of RIS elements, which adaptively and remarkably manages the system's power consumption.To this end, a resource management problem is formulated, aiming to maximize the system energy efficiency (EE) by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming at the BS, the element activation, the phase shift and the amplification factor at the RIS, the RSMA common data rate at users, as well as the UAV's trajectory.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Due to the dynamicity nature of UAV and user mobility, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is designed for resource allocation, utilizing meta-learning to adaptively handle fast time-varying system dynamics. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span>Simulations indicate that incorporating an active RIS at the UAV leads to substantial EE gain, compared to passive RIS-aided UAV.We observe the superiority of the RSMA-based AARIS system in terms of EE, compared to existing approaches adopting non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA).</p>
