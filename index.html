                  <p>Recent work demonstrated great promise in the idea of orchestrating collaborations between LLMs, human input, and various tools to address the inherent limitations of LLMs.We propose a novel perspective called semantic decoding, which frames these collaborative processes as optimization procedures in semantic space.Specifically, we conceptualize LLMs as semantic processors that manipulate meaningful pieces of information that we call semantic tokens (known thoughts).LLMs are among a large pool of other semantic processors, including humans and tools, such as search engines or code executors.Collectively, semantic processors engage in dynamic exchanges of semantic tokens to progressively construct high-utility outputs.We refer to these orchestrated interactions among semantic processors, optimizing and searching in semantic space, as semantic decoding algorithms.This concept draws a direct parallel to the well-studied problem of syntactic decoding, which involves crafting algorithms to best exploit auto-regressive language models for extracting high-utility sequences of syntactic tokens.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>By focusing on the semantic level and disregarding syntactic details, we gain a fresh perspective on the engineering of AI systems, enabling us to imagine systems with much greater complexity and capabilities. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.857</span></span>In this position paper, we formalize the transition from syntactic to semantic tokens as well as the analogy between syntactic and semantic decoding.Subsequently, we explore the possibilities of optimizing within the space of semantic tokens via semantic decoding algorithms.We conclude with a list of research opportunities and questions arising from this fresh perspective.The semantic decoding perspective offers a powerful abstraction for search and optimization directly in the space of meaningful concepts, with semantic tokens as the fundamental units of a new type of computation.</p>

                  <p>Language agents have demonstrated autonomous decision-making abilities by reasoning with foundation models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recently, efforts have been made to train language agents for performance improvement, with multi-step reasoning and action trajectories as the training data. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.826</span></span>However, collecting such trajectories still requires considerable human effort, by either artificial annotations or implementations of diverse prompting frameworks.In this work, we propose A$^3$T, a framework that enables the Autonomous Annotation of Agent Trajectories in the style of ReAct.The central role is an ActRe prompting agent, which explains the reason for an arbitrary action.When randomly sampling an external action, the ReAct-style agent could query the ActRe agent with the action to obtain its textual rationales.Novel trajectories are then synthesized by prepending the posterior reasoning from ActRe to the sampled action.In this way, the ReAct-style agent executes multiple trajectories for the failed tasks, and selects the successful ones to supplement its failed trajectory for contrastive self-training.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Realized by policy gradient methods with binarized rewards, the contrastive self-training with accumulated trajectories facilitates a closed loop for multiple rounds of language agent self-improvement. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.831</span></span>We conduct experiments using QLoRA fine-tuning with the open-sourced Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2.In AlfWorld, the agent trained with A$^3$T obtains a 1-shot success rate of 96%, and 100% success with 4 iterative rounds.In WebShop, the 1-shot performance of the A$^3$T agent matches human average, and 4 rounds of iterative refinement lead to the performance approaching human experts.A$^3$T agents significantly outperform existing techniques, including prompting with GPT-4, advanced agent frameworks, and fully fine-tuned LLMs.</p>

                  <p>Magnetic microrobots can be navigated by an external magnetic field to autonomously move within living organisms with complex and unstructured environments.Potential applications include drug delivery, diagnostics, and therapeutic interventions.Existing techniques commonly impart magnetic properties to the target object,or drive the robot to contact and then manipulate the object, both probably inducing physical damage.This paper considers a non-contact formulation, where the robot spins to generate a repulsive field to push the object without physical contact.Under such a formulation, the main challenge is that the motion model between the input of the magnetic field and the output velocity of the target object is commonly unknown and difficult to analyze.To deal with it, this paper proposes a data-driven-based solution.A neural network is constructed to efficiently estimate the motion model.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Then, an approximate model-based optimal control scheme is developed to push the object to track a time-varying trajectory, maintaining the non-contact with distance constraints. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.843</span></span>Furthermore, a straightforward planner is introduced to assess the adaptability of non-contact manipulation in a cluttered unstructured environment.Experimental results are presented to show the tracking and navigation performance of the proposed scheme.</p>

                  <p>Safe and efficient object manipulation is a key enabler of many real-world robot applications.However, this is challenging because robot operation must be robust to a range of sensor and actuator uncertainties.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we present a physics-informed causal-inference-based framework for a robot to probabilistically reason about candidate actions in a block stacking task in a partially observable setting. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.846</span></span>We integrate a physics-based simulation of the rigid-body system dynamics with a causal Bayesian network (CBN) formulation to define a causal generative probabilistic model of the robot decision-making process.Using simulation-based Monte Carlo experiments, we demonstrate our framework's ability to successfully: (1) predict block tower stability with high accuracy (Pred Acc: 88.6%); and, (2) select an approximate next-best action for the block stacking task, for execution by an integrated robot system, achieving 94.2% task success rate.We also demonstrate our framework's suitability for real-world robot systems by demonstrating successful task executions with a domestic support robot, with perception and manipulation sub-system integration.Hence, we show that by embedding physics-based causal reasoning into robots' decision-making processes, we can make robot task execution safer, more reliable, and more robust to various types of uncertainty.</p>
