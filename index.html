                  <p>Efforts to reduce maternal mortality rate, a key UN Sustainable Development target (SDG Target 3.1), rely largely on preventative care programs to spread critical health information to high-risk populations.These programs face two important challenges: efficiently allocating limited health resources to large beneficiary populations, and adapting to evolving policy priorities.While prior works in restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) demonstrated success in public health allocation tasks, they lack flexibility to adapt to evolving policy priorities.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as adept, automated planners in various domains, including robotic control and navigation. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.826</span></span>In this paper, we propose DLM: a Decision Language Model for RMABs.To enable dynamic fine-tuning of RMAB policies for challenging public health settings using human-language commands, we propose using LLMs as automated planners to (1) interpret human policy preference prompts, (2) propose code reward functions for a multi-agent RL environment for RMABs, and (3) iterate on the generated reward using feedback from RMAB simulations to effectively adapt policy outcomes.In collaboration with ARMMAN, an India-based public health organization promoting preventative care for pregnant mothers, we conduct a simulation study, showing DLM can dynamically shape policy outcomes using only human language commands as input.</p>

                  <p>Preference learning (PL) with large language models (LLMs) aims to align the LLMs' generations with human preferences.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Previous work on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated promising results in in-distribution PL. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.827</span></span>However, due to the difficulty of obtaining human feedback, discretely training reward models for every encountered distribution is challenging.Thus, out-of-distribution (OOD) PL is practically useful for enhancing the generalization ability of LLMs with limited preference feedback.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work addresses OOD PL by optimizing a general reward model through a meta-learning approach. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.821</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>During meta-training, a bilevel optimization algorithm is utilized to learn a reward model capable of guiding policy learning to align with human preferences across various distributions. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.824</span></span>When encountering a test distribution, the meta-test procedure conducts regularized policy optimization using the learned reward model for PL.We theoretically demonstrate the convergence rate of the bilevel optimization algorithm under reasonable assumptions.Additionally, we conduct experiments on two text generation tasks across 20 held-out domains and outperform a variety of strong baselines across various evaluation metrics.</p>
