                The Role of Marketing in Public Policy Decision Making: The Case of Fuel Subsidy Removal in Nigeria

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Public policy decision making has become more complex and complicated in recent times. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.826</span></span>Some authors have attributed this to the fact that public policy decision makers now have more variables to consider in every decision more than ever before.Others have argued that the rate of civilization, globalization and information technology has made the public to be more enlightened and abreast with the activities of government and so can oppose government decisions if they are unfavourable.This tends to increase government need for more and better information in order to satisfy the public.Consequently, this paper examined the issue of fuel subsidy removal in Nigeria, the impact of the policy on the public as well as the country and the role marketing principles would have played if the Nigerian government had taken some time to investigate what should be done, how it should be done and when it should be done.It also proposed a roadmap for future policies that have direct implications for the general public.</p>
