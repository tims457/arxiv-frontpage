                  <p>The stochastic $H_{\infty}$ control is studied for a linear stochastic It\^o system with an unknown system model.The linear stochastic $H_{\infty}$ control issue is known to be transformable into the problem of solving a so-called generalized algebraic Riccati equation (GARE), which is a nonlinear equation that is typically difficult to solve analytically.Worse, model-based techniques cannot be utilized to approximately solve a GARE when an accurate system model is unavailable or prohibitively expensive to construct in reality.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To address these issues, an off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) approach is presented to learn the solution of a GARE from real system data rather than a system model; its convergence is demonstrated, and the robustness of RL to errors in the learning process is investigated. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.85</span></span>In the off-policy RL approach, the system data may be created with behavior policies rather than the target policies, which is highly significant and promising for use in actual systems.Finally, the proposed off-policy RL approach is validated on a stochastic linear F-16 aircraft system.</p>

                  <p>We introduce a cooperative Bayesian optimization problem for optimizing black-box functions of two variables where two agents choose together at which points to query the function but have only control over one variable each.This setting is inspired by human-AI teamwork, where an AI-assistant helps its human user solve a problem, in this simplest case, collaborative optimization.We formulate the solution as sequential decision-making, where the agent we control models the user as a computationally rational agent with prior knowledge about the function.We show that strategic planning of the queries enables better identification of the global maximum of the function as long as the user avoids excessive exploration.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This planning is made possible by using Bayes Adaptive Monte Carlo planning and by endowing the agent with a user model that accounts for conservative belief updates and exploratory sampling of the points to query. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span></p>
