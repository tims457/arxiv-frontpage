                  <p>Problem: Effective patient-centered communication is a core competency for physicians.However, both seasoned providers and medical trainees report decreased confidence in leading conversations on sensitive topics such as goals of care or end-of-life discussions.The significant administrative burden and the resources required to provide dedicated training in leading difficult conversations has been a long-standing problem in medical education.   Approach:<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we present a novel educational tool designed to facilitate interactive, real-time simulations of difficult conversations in a video-based format through the use of multimodal generative artificial intelligence (AI). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.852</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Leveraging recent advances in language modeling, computer vision, and generative audio, this tool creates realistic, interactive scenarios with avatars, or "synthetic patients." <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.831</span></span>These synthetic patients interact with users throughout various stages of medical care using a custom-built video chat application, offering learners the chance to practice conversations with patients from diverse belief systems, personalities, and ethnic backgrounds.   Outcomes: While the development of this platform demanded substantial upfront investment in labor, it offers a highly-realistic simulation experience with minimal financial investment.For medical trainees, this educational tool can be implemented within programs to simulate patient-provider conversations and can be incorporated into existing palliative care curriculum to provide a scalable, high-fidelity simulation environment for mastering difficult conversations.   Next Steps:Future developments will explore enhancing the authenticity of these encounters by working with patients to incorporate their histories and personalities, as well as employing the use of AI-generated evaluations to offer immediate, constructive feedback to learners post-simulation.</p>
