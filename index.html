                  <p>Geometry problem solving presents a formidable challenge within the NLP community.Existing approaches often rely on models designed for solving math word problems, neglecting the unique characteristics of geometry math problems.Additionally, the current research predominantly focuses on geometry calculation problems, while overlooking other essential aspects like proving.In this study, we address these limitations by proposing the Geometry-Aware Problem Solver (GAPS) model.GAPS is specifically designed to generate solution programs for geometry math problems of various types with the help of its unique problem-type classifier.To achieve this, GAPS treats the solution program as a composition of operators and operands, segregating their generation processes.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we introduce the geometry elements enhancement method, which enhances the ability of GAPS to recognize geometry elements accurately. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.938</span></span>By leveraging these improvements, GAPS showcases remarkable performance in resolving geometry math problems.Our experiments conducted on the UniGeo dataset demonstrate the superiority of GAPS over the state-of-the-art model, Geoformer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Specifically, GAPS achieves an accuracy improvement of more than 5.3% for calculation tasks and an impressive 41.1% for proving tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.949</span></span>Notably, GAPS achieves an impressive accuracy of 97.5% on proving problems, representing a significant advancement in solving geometry proving tasks.</p>

                Curriculum-Based Reinforcement Learning for Quadrupedal Jumping: A Reference-free Design

                  <p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising solution to mastering explosive and versatile quadrupedal jumping skills.However, current DRL-based frameworks usually rely on well-defined reference trajectories, which are obtained by capturing animal motions or transferring experience from existing controllers.This work explores the possibility of learning dynamic jumping without imitating a reference trajectory.To this end, we incorporate a curriculum design into DRL so as to accomplish challenging tasks progressively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Starting from a vertical in-place jump, we then generalize the learned policy to forward and diagonal jumps and, finally, learn to jump across obstacles. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.962</span></span>Conditioned on the desired landing location, orientation, and obstacle dimensions, the proposed approach contributes to a wide range of jumping motions, including omnidirectional jumping and robust jumping, alleviating the effort to extract references in advance.Particularly, without constraints from the reference motion, a 90cm forward jump is achieved, exceeding previous records for similar robots reported in the existing literature.Additionally, continuous jumping on the soft grassy floor is accomplished, even when it is not encountered in the training stage.A supplementary video showing our results can be found at https://youtu.be/nRaMCrwU5X8 .</p>
