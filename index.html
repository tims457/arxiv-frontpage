In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology and the framework to study both, the decision-making of LLMs and their alignment with human behavior under emotional states.Experiments with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on four games from two different classes of behavioral game theory showed that emotions profoundly impact the performance of LLMs, leading to the development of more optimal strategies.While there is a strong alignment between the behavioral responses of GPT-3.5 and human participants, particularly evident in bargaining games, GPT-4 exhibits consistent behavior, ignoring induced emotions for rationality decisions.Surprisingly, emotional prompting, particularly with `anger' emotion, can disrupt the "superhuman" alignment of GPT-4, resembling human emotional responses.</p>

                  <p>Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) is a growing field that demands a deep understanding of legal, spatial and temporal concepts in navigation.Hence, any implementation of AAM is forced to deal with the inherent uncertainties of human-inhabited spaces.Enabling growth and innovation requires the creation of a system for safe and robust mission design, i.e., the way we formalize intentions and decide their execution as trajectories for the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).Although legal frameworks have emerged to govern urban air spaces, their full integration into the decision process of autonomous agents and operators remains an open task.In this work we present ProMis, a system architecture for probabilistic mission design.It links the data available from various static and dynamic data sources with legal text and operator requirements by following principles of formal verification and probabilistic modeling.Hereby, ProMis enables the combination of low-level perception and high-level rules in AAM to infer validity over the UAV's state-space.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we employ Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs (HPLP) as a unifying, intermediate representation between perception and action-taking. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span>Furthermore, we present methods to connect ProMis with crowd-sourced map data by generating HPLP atoms that represent spatial relations in a probabilistic fashion.Our claims of the utility and generality of ProMis are supported by experiments on a diverse set of scenarios and a discussion of the computational demands associated with probabilistic missions.</p>
