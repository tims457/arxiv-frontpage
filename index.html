                  <p>The robot position speculation, which determines where the chassis should move, is one key step to control the mobile manipulators.The target position must ensure the feasibility of chassis movement and manipulability, which is guaranteed by randomized sampling and kinematic checking in traditional methods.Addressing the demands of agile robotics, this paper proposes a robot position speculation network(RPSN), a learning-based approach to enhance the agility of mobile manipulators.The RPSN incorporates a differentiable inverse kinematic algorithm and a neural network.Through end-to-end training, the RPSN can speculate positions with a high success rate.We apply the RPSN to mobile manipulators disassembling end-of-life electric vehicle batteries (EOL-EVBs).Extensive experiments on various simulated environments and physical mobile manipulators demonstrate that the probability of the initial position provided by RPSN being the ideal position is 96.67%.From the kinematic constraint perspective, it achieves 100% generation of the ideal position on average within 1.28 attempts.Much lower than that of random sampling, 31.04.Moreover, the proposed method demonstrates superior data efficiency over pure neural network approaches.The proposed RPSN enables the robot to quickly infer feasible target positions by intuition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This work moves towards building agile robots that can act swiftly like humans. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.836</span></span></p>

Our sample complexity bound improves upon the state-of-art $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity for CMDP problems established in the previous literature, in terms of the dependency on $\epsilon$. To achieve this advance, we develop a new framework for analyzing CMDP problems.To be specific, our algorithm operates in the primal space and we resolve the primal LP for the CMDP problem at each period in an online manner, with \textit{adaptive} remaining resource capacities.The key elements of our algorithm are: i).an eliminating procedure that characterizes one optimal basis of the primal LP, and; ii) a resolving procedure that is adaptive to the remaining resources and sticks to the characterized optimal basis.</p>
