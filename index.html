                  <p>Object navigation (ObjectNav) requires an agent to navigate through unseen environments to find queried objects.Many previous methods attempted to solve this task by relying on supervised or reinforcement learning, where they are trained on limited household datasets with close-set objects.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, two key challenges are unsolved: understanding free-form natural language instructions that demand open-set objects, and generalizing to new environments in a zero-shot manner. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.823</span></span>Aiming to solve the two challenges, in this paper, we propose OpenFMNav, an Open-set Foundation Model based framework for zero-shot object Navigation.We first unleash the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) to extract proposed objects from natural language instructions that meet the user's demand.We then leverage the generalizability of large vision language models (VLMs) to actively discover and detect candidate objects from the scene, building a Versatile Semantic Score Map (VSSM).Then, by conducting common sense reasoning on VSSM, our method can perform effective language-guided exploration and exploitation of the scene and finally reach the goal.By leveraging the reasoning and generalizing abilities of foundation models, our method can understand free-form human instructions and perform effective open-set zero-shot navigation in diverse environments.Extensive experiments on the HM3D ObjectNav benchmark show that our method surpasses all the strong baselines on all metrics, proving our method's effectiveness.Furthermore, we perform real robot demonstrations to validate our method's open-set-ness and generalizability to real-world environments.</p>

                  <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) can effectively learn complex policies.However, learning these policies often demands extensive trial-and-error interactions with the environment.In many real-world scenarios, this approach is not practical due to the high costs of data collection and safety concerns.As a result, a common strategy is to transfer a policy trained in a low-cost, rapid source simulator to a real-world target environment.However, this process poses challenges.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Simulators, no matter how advanced, cannot perfectly replicate the intricacies of the real world, leading to dynamics discrepancies between the source and target environments. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.823</span></span>Past research posited that the source domain must encompass all possible target transitions, a condition we term full support.However, expecting full support is often unrealistic, especially in scenarios where significant dynamics discrepancies arise.In this paper, our emphasis shifts to addressing large dynamics mismatch adaptation.We move away from the stringent full support condition of earlier research, focusing instead on crafting an effective policy for the target domain.Our proposed approach is simple but effective.It is anchored in the central concepts of the skewing and extension of source support towards target support to mitigate support deficiencies.Through comprehensive testing on a varied set of benchmarks, our method's efficacy stands out, showcasing notable improvements over previous techniques.</p>

                  <p>Engineering components must meet increasing technological demands in ever shorter development cycles.To face these challenges, a holistic approach is essential that allows for the concurrent development of part design, material system and manufacturing process.Current approaches employ numerical simulations, which however quickly becomes computation-intensive, especially for iterative optimization.Data-driven machine learning methods can be used to replace time- and resource-intensive numerical simulations.In particular, MeshGraphNets (MGNs) have shown promising results.They enable fast and accurate predictions on unseen mesh geometries while being fully differentiable for optimization.However, these models rely on large amounts of expensive training data, such as numerical simulations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer an opportunity to train neural networks with partial differential equations instead of labeled data, but have not been extended yet to handle time-dependent simulations of arbitrary meshes. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.824</span></span>This work introduces PI-MGNs, a hybrid approach that combines PINNs and MGNs to quickly and accurately solve non-stationary and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) on arbitrary meshes.The method is exemplified for thermal process simulations of unseen parts with inhomogeneous material distribution.Further results show that the model scales well to large and complex meshes, although it is trained on small generic meshes only.</p>

                  <p>Building on a previous foundation work (Lussange et al. 2020), this study introduces a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) model simulating crypto markets, which is calibrated to the Binance's daily closing prices of $153$ cryptocurrencies that were continuously traded between 2018 and 2022.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Unlike previous agent-based models (ABM) or multi-agent systems (MAS) which relied on zero-intelligence agents or single autonomous agent methodologies, our approach relies on endowing agents with reinforcement learning (RL) techniques in order to model crypto markets. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.83</span></span>This integration is designed to emulate, with a bottom-up approach to complexity inference, both individual and collective agents, ensuring robustness in the recent volatile conditions of such markets and during the COVID-19 era.A key feature of our model also lies in the fact that its autonomous agents perform asset price valuation based on two sources of information: the market prices themselves, and the approximation of the crypto assets fundamental values beyond what those market prices are.Our MAS calibration against real market data allows for an accurate emulation of crypto markets microstructure and probing key market behaviors, in both the bearish and bullish regimes of that particular time period.</p>
