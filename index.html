                  <p>Uncertainty is a key feature of any machine learning model and is particularly important in neural networks, which tend to be overconfident.This overconfidence is worrying under distribution shifts, where the model performance silently degrades as the data distribution diverges from the training data distribution.Uncertainty estimation offers a solution to overconfident models, communicating when the output should (not) be trusted.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Although methods for uncertainty estimation have been developed, they have not been explicitly linked to the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.824</span></span>Furthermore, literature in operations research ignores the actionability component of uncertainty estimation and does not consider distribution shifts.This work proposes a general uncertainty framework, with contributions being threefold: (i) uncertainty estimation in ML models is positioned as an XAI technique, giving local and model-specific explanations; (ii) classification with rejection is used to reduce misclassifications by bringing a human expert in the loop for uncertain observations; (iii) the framework is applied to a case study on neural networks in educational data mining subject to distribution shifts.Uncertainty as XAI improves the model's trustworthiness in downstream decision-making tasks, giving rise to more actionable and robust machine learning systems in operations research.</p>

                  <p>Humanoid robots hold great promise in assisting humans in diverse environments and tasks, due to their flexibility and adaptability leveraging human-like morphology.However, research in humanoid robots is often bottlenecked by the costly and fragile hardware setups.To accelerate algorithmic research in humanoid robots, we present a high-dimensional, simulated robot learning benchmark, HumanoidBench, featuring a humanoid robot equipped with dexterous hands and a variety of challenging whole-body manipulation and locomotion tasks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms struggle with most tasks, whereas a hierarchical learning baseline achieves superior performance when supported by robust low-level policies, such as walking or reaching. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.833</span></span>With HumanoidBench, we provide the robotics community with a platform to identify the challenges arising when solving diverse tasks with humanoid robots, facilitating prompt verification of algorithms and ideas.The open-source code is available at https://sferrazza.cc/humanoidbench_site.</p>

                  <p>Quadruped robots demonstrate robust and agile movements in various terrains; however, their navigation autonomy is still insufficient.One of the challenges is that the motion capabilities of the quadruped robot are anisotropic along different directions, which significantly affects the safety of quadruped robot navigation.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This paper proposes a navigation framework that takes into account the motion anisotropy of quadruped robots including kinodynamic trajectory generation, nonlinear trajectory optimization, and nonlinear model predictive control. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.821</span></span>In simulation and real robot tests, we demonstrate that our motion-anisotropy-aware navigation framework could: (1) generate more efficient trajectories and realize more agile quadruped navigation; (2) significantly improve the navigation safety in challenging scenarios.The implementation is realized as an open-source package at https://github.com/ZWT006/agile_navigation.</p>

                  <p>Integrated task and motion planning (TAMP) has proven to be a valuable approach to generalizable long-horizon robotic manipulation and navigation problems.However, the typical TAMP problem formulation assumes full observability and deterministic action effects.These assumptions limit the ability of the planner to gather information and make decisions that are risk-aware.We propose a strategy for TAMP with Uncertainty and Risk Awareness (TAMPURA) that is capable of efficiently solving long-horizon planning problems with initial-state and action outcome uncertainty, including problems that require information gathering and avoiding undesirable and irreversible outcomes.Our planner reasons under uncertainty at both the abstract task level and continuous controller level.Given a set of closed-loop goal-conditioned controllers operating in the primitive action space and a description of their preconditions and potential capabilities, we learn a high-level abstraction that can be solved efficiently and then refined to continuous actions for execution.We demonstrate our approach on several robotics problems where uncertainty is a crucial factor and show that reasoning under uncertainty in these problems outperforms previously proposed determinized planning, direct search, and reinforcement learning strategies.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Lastly, we demonstrate our planner on two real-world robotics problems using recent advancements in probabilistic perception. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span></p>
