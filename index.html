                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) are demonstrating remarkable capabilities across various tasks despite lacking a foundation in human cognition.This raises the question: can these models, beyond simply mimicking human language patterns, offer insights into the mechanisms underlying human cognition?This study explores the ability of ChatGPT to predict human performance in a language-based memory task.Building upon theories of text comprehension, we hypothesize that recognizing ambiguous sentences (e.g., "Because Bill drinks wine is never kept in the house") is facilitated by preceding them with contextually relevant information.Participants, both human and ChatGPT, were presented with pairs of sentences.The second sentence was always a garden-path sentence designed to be inherently ambiguous, while the first sentence either provided a fitting (e.g., "Bill has chronic alcoholism") or an unfitting context (e.g., "Bill likes to play golf").We measured both human's and ChatGPT's ratings of sentence relatedness, ChatGPT's memorability ratings for the garden-path sentences, and humans' spontaneous memory for the garden-path sentences.The results revealed a striking alignment between ChatGPT's assessments and human performance.Sentences deemed more related and assessed as being more memorable by ChatGPT were indeed better remembered by humans, even though ChatGPT's internal mechanisms likely differ significantly from human cognition.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This finding, which was confirmed with a robustness check employing synonyms, underscores the potential of generative AI models to predict human performance accurately. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span>We discuss the broader implications of these findings for leveraging LLMs in the development of psychological theories and for gaining a deeper understanding of human cognition.</p>
