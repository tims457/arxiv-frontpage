                  <p>Semantic communication (SemCom) is emerging as a key technology for future sixth-generation (6G) systems.Unlike traditional bit-level communication (BitCom), SemCom directly optimizes performance at the semantic level, leading to supe- rior communication efficiency.Nevertheless, the task-oriented nature of SemCom renders it challenging to completely replace BitCom.Consequently, it is desired to consider a semantic-bit coexisting communication system, where a base station (BS) serves SemCom users (sem-users) and BitCom users (bit-users) simultaneously.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Such a system faces severe and heterogeneous inter-user interference. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.825</span></span>In this context, this paper provides a new semantic-bit coexisting communication framework and proposes a spatial beamforming scheme to accommodate both types of users.Specifically, we consider maximizing the semantic rate for semantic users while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for bit-users.Due to the intractability of obtaining the exact closed-form expression of the semantic rate, a data driven method is first applied to attain an approximated expression via data fitting.With the resulting complex transcendental function, majorization minimization (MM) is adopted to convert the original formulated problem into a multiple-ratio problem, which allows fractional programming (FP) to be used to further transform the problem into an inhomogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQP) problem.Solving the problem leads to a semi-closed form solution with undetermined Lagrangian factors that can be updated by a fixed point algorithm.Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed beamforming scheme significantly outperforms conventional beamforming algorithms such as zero-forcing (ZF), maximum ratio transmission (MRT), and weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE).</p>
