                  <p>A tremendous range of design tasks in materials, physics, and biology can be formulated as finding the optimum of an objective function depending on many parameters without knowing its closed-form expression or the derivative.Traditional derivative-free optimization techniques often rely on strong assumptions about objective functions, thereby failing at optimizing non-convex systems beyond 100 dimensions.Here, we present a tree search method for derivative-free optimization that enables accelerated optimal design of high-dimensional complex systems.Specifically, we introduce stochastic tree expansion, dynamic upper confidence bound, and short-range backpropagation mechanism to evade local optimum, iteratively approximating the global optimum using machine learning models.This development effectively confronts the dimensionally challenging problems, achieving convergence to global optima across various benchmark functions up to 2,000 dimensions, surpassing the existing methods by 10- to 20-fold.Our method demonstrates wide applicability to a wide range of real-world complex systems spanning materials, physics, and biology, considerably outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This enables efficient autonomous knowledge discovery and facilitates self-driving virtual laboratories. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.821</span></span>Although we focus on problems within the realm of natural science, the advancements in optimization techniques achieved herein are applicable to a broader spectrum of challenges across all quantitative disciplines.</p>

                  <p>Context: In the realm of software development, maintaining high software quality is a persistent challenge.However, this challenge is often impeded by the lack of comprehensive understanding of how specific code modifications influence quality metrics.   Objective: This study ventures to bridge this gap through an approach that aspires to assess and interpret the impact of code modifications.The underlying hypothesis posits that code modifications inducing similar changes in software quality metrics can be grouped into distinct clusters, which can be effectively described using an AI language model, thus providing a simple understanding of code changes and their quality implications.   Method: To validate this hypothesis, we built and analyzed a dataset from popular GitHub repositories, segmented into individual code modifications.Each project was evaluated against software quality metrics pre and post-application.Machine learning techniques were utilized to cluster these modifications based on the induced changes in the metrics.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Simultaneously, an AI language model was employed to generate descriptions of each modification's function.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.832</span></span>Results:The results reveal distinct clusters of code modifications, each accompanied by a concise description, revealing their collective impact on software quality metrics.   Conclusions: The findings suggest that this research is a significant step towards a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationship between code changes and software quality, which has the potential to transform software maintenance strategies and enable the development of more accurate quality prediction models.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we propose a generalized conditional gradient method for multiobjective optimization, which can be viewed as an improved extension of the classical Frank-Wolfe (conditional gradient) method for single-objective optimization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The proposed method works for both constrained and unconstrained benchmark multiobjective optimization problems, where the objective function is the summation of a smooth function and a possibly nonsmooth convex function. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.822</span></span>The method combines the so-called normalized descent direction as an adaptive procedure and the line search technique.We prove the convergence of the algorithm with respect to Pareto optimality under mild assumptions.The iteration complexity for obtaining an approximate Pareto critical point and the convergence rate in terms of a merit function is also analyzed.Finally, we report some numerical results, which demonstrate the feasibility and competitiveness of the proposed method.</p>
